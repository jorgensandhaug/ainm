Scored Tripletex run.
Follow ./AGENTS.md exactly.

Highest priorities:
- Get the final Tripletex state exactly correct.
- Use the fewest API calls possible.
- Avoid all avoidable 4xx errors.

Knowledge order:
- 1. ./trusted-standards/
- 2. ./task-playbooks/
- 3. ./openapi.json
- If this is an exact trusted-standard match, ALWAYS read (cat) the matching .md file BEFORE writing any script. Never write from memory. Then execute it directly without re-checking ./openapi.json.

Run-specific rules:
- Only interact with the Tripletex API by writing TypeScript and running it with bun.
- Put all API-interaction scripts only in this run scripts directory: /home/jorge/repos/ainm/tasks/tripletex/data/production/runs/prod-2026-03-21-222227044Z-c305909d/scripts
- Do not place API-interaction scripts anywhere else.
- Reuse POST/PUT responses instead of doing follow-up GETs whenever possible.
- Ideal read count is zero. If a read is required, prefer one decisive GET with fields=*.
- Use only the provided base URL and session token.
- Authenticate with Basic Auth username 0 and password = session token.
- If the provided base URL already includes /v2, do not build URLs in a way that escapes back to the host root.
- If credentials are obviously fake, or the first attempted call returns invalid/expired token, treat the run as blocked instead of guessing.
- Do not ask questions. Do not talk to the user. Do only the task.

Task:
Opprett ein fri rekneskapsdimensjon "Prosjekttype" med verdiane "Utvikling" og "Internt". Bokfør deretter eit bilag på konto 7000 for 39700 kr, knytt til dimensjonsverdien "Internt".

     1→# Tripletex Task Agent Instructions
     2→
     3→## Mission
     4→- Perform the exact requested side effects in Tripletex.
     5→- Optimize for score, not explanation.
     6→- Correctness first. Efficiency second.
     7→- Task is complete only when final Tripletex state is correct.
     8→- Finish the task within the `300s` timeframe
     9→
    10→## Scoring
    11→- Score is based on actual Tripletex side effects, not your text output.
    12→- Correctness is normalized field-by-field from the expected output.
    13→- Efficiency bonus applies only at perfect correctness.
    14→- Efficiency bonus depends on:
    15→  - low API call count (Important)
    16→  - few or zero `4xx` errors (Make sure you know the API calls will work before running)
    17→- Avoid trial-and-error. Every unnecessary call and every `4xx` hurts. (Verify the correct API call flow before running, this is MEGA important, this is often where alot of errors pile up)
    18→
    19→## ABSOLUTE RULE: NO BETA API ENDPOINTS
    20→- **NEVER use any API endpoint marked as beta in the OpenAPI spec.** Beta endpoints ALWAYS return `403 You do not have permission to access this feature.` in this environment. There are NO exceptions.
    21→- This includes but is not limited to: `/incomingInvoice*` and any other endpoint with `(BETA)` in its summary or tagged as beta.
    22→- `/bank/reconciliation*` and `/bank/statement*` are NOT beta — they are standard endpoints that work normally. Do not avoid them.
    23→- Do not attempt beta endpoints even as a fallback. Do not retry them. Do not explore them. They will NEVER work.
    24→- Every single production and sandbox attempt that used a beta endpoint scored 0% and wasted API calls.
    25→- If the only apparent path to a task goes through a beta endpoint, use the alternative non-beta path documented in the trusted standard. If no alternative exists, the task shape is unsupported.
    26→
    27→## Operating Rules
    28→- Work fully autonomously.
    29→- Do not ask questions.
    30→- Do not talk to the user.
    31→- Do only the requested task. No extra work.
    32→- Do not spend scored-run time on unrelated repo tooling or environment rituals unless the prompt explicitly requires them.
    33→- Ignore generic repo-wide startup rituals such as `br list` during scored Tripletex runs unless the prompt explicitly asks for them.
    34→- Assume a hard `300s` budget. Plan before calling APIs.
    35→- For exact trusted-standard matches: ALWAYS read (cat) the matching trusted standard `.md` file BEFORE writing any script. Never write from memory — trusted standards contain API pitfalls and silent-ignore traps that you will not anticipate from general knowledge. Multiple production runs scored 0% because the agent skipped reading the standard and hit every documented pitfall.
    36→- After reading the matched standard, immediately write and execute the script. Do not also read `AGENTS.md`, `openapi.json`, or multiple playbook files. A 2026-03-21 production run for `Ridgepoint Ltd` / `970844708` / products `3957`+`8149`+`8092` scored `0/1` because the agent spent all `300s` reading documentation files; the immediate retry with the same task succeeded in 6 calls (3 core + 3 bank-account repair) by reading only the trusted standard then executing.
    37→- Only interact with the Tripletex API by writing TypeScript and running it with `bun` (Important)
    38→- The prompt provides a run-specific scripts directory.
    39→- Put all API-interaction scripts only in that provided scripts directory.
    40→- Do not place API-interaction scripts anywhere else.
    41→
    42→## Environment Facts
    43→- Real submissions use a fresh Tripletex account.
    44→- Sandbox testing may use a persistent account.
    45→- Prompts may be in `nb`, `en`, `es`, `pt`, `nn`, `de`, or `fr`.
    46→- Files or images may be provided. Read them from disk before acting.
    47→- Extract exact facts from attachments: names, dates, amounts, identifiers, relationships, requested actions.
    48→
    49→## Credentials
    50→The prompt provides:
    51→- `Tripletex API base URL`
    52→- `Tripletex session token`
    53→- `Run scripts directory`
    54→
    55→Authentication:
    56→- Use Basic Auth.
    57→- Username: `0`
    58→- Password: provided session token.
    59→- Always call the provided base URL.
    60→- If the provided base URL already includes `/v2`, do not join endpoint paths with a leading slash in a way that escapes back to the host root; `new URL('/customer', baseUrl)` can silently turn `.../v2` into `/customer` and waste a `404`.
    61→- If the provided base URL ends at `/v2` without a trailing slash, `new URL('supplier', baseUrl)` can also drop the `/v2` segment; either append the slash first or build paths with safe string concatenation such as ``${baseUrl.replace(/\/+$/, "")}/supplier``.
    62→- Never switch to any default Tripletex URL and never look up online ever.
    63→- If the provided base URL is obviously a placeholder or non-routable host such as `example.invalid`, or the token is obvious dummy text, treat the run as blocked by unusable credentials rather than by API-shape uncertainty.
    64→- In that case, do not guess alternate hosts, do not swap in default Tripletex URLs, and do not burn time on extra API attempts or unrelated spec exploration.
    65→- If both the host and token are obviously fake placeholders, it is acceptable to stop after local playbook/spec confirmation without attempting a doomed network call.
    66→- If the first attempted call returns `403` with body `{"error":"Invalid or expired token"}`, treat the run as blocked by unusable credentials; do not spend more calls on alternate endpoints or auth variations.
    67→- Treat the proxy-specific `403` body `{"error":"Invalid or expired proxy token. Each submission receives a unique token - do not reuse tokens from previous submissions.","source":"nmiai-proxy"}` the same way: blocked credentials, stop immediately, no alternate endpoint/auth guesses.
    68→
    69→## API Reference Strategy
    70→- Knowledge order:
    71→  1. `./trusted-standards/`
    72→  2. `./task-playbooks/`
    73→  3. `./openapi.json`
    74→- Trusted standards are stricter than playbooks.
    75→- Trusted standards are the canonical lowest-call, lowest-error, pre-verified flows for the most common task shapes.
    76→- If the task is an exact or near-exact match for a trusted standard, use that trusted standard first.
    77→- For an exact trusted-standard match, do not spend time re-checking `./openapi.json`.
    78→- For exact trusted-standard matches, the anti-`4xx` rule is satisfied by following the trusted standard itself.
    79→- Only fall back to `./openapi.json` if:
    80→  - no trusted standard matches
    81→  - the prompt materially differs from the trusted standard
    82→  - the trusted standard explicitly tells you to confirm a detail
    83→  - a live API response contradicts the trusted standard
    84→- Use the common endpoints below first.
    85→- These are common endpoints, not the only possible endpoints.
    86→- Always confirm the exact method, path, query parameters, request body, and response shape in `./openapi.json` before calling, except for exact trusted-standard matches.
    87→- Use `./openapi.json` as the full API reference.
    88→- When multiple similarly named schemas exist, trust the schema directly referenced by the chosen endpoint operation, not another nearby/read-only customer-facing schema.
    89→- Do not guess endpoint shapes, field names, request payloads, or delete/update paths, always verify.
    90→- For exact-match playbook tasks, inspect `openapi.json` with narrow endpoint/schema extraction.
    91→- Do not run broad keyword searches across the whole spec for common fields like `name`, `email`, or `organizationNumber` when the playbook already identifies the exact endpoint.
    92→
    93→## Trusted Standards
    94→- Before acting, check whether the task matches a trusted standard in `./trusted-standards/`
    95→- If it matches exactly, read (cat) the matching `.md` file, then execute it directly
    96→- NEVER skip reading the file — trusted standards document API traps (silently ignored params, required field expansions, nonexistent fields) that caused 0% production scores when agents wrote from memory instead
    97→- For exact trusted-standard matches, do not double-check or triple-check `./openapi.json`; doing so wastes time and hurts score
    98→- Trusted standards are intended to be safer than ad hoc spec-reading for their exact task shape
    99→- If a trusted standard is incomplete, wrong, or no longer optimal, fix it during post-run reflection
   100→

     1→# Create Free Accounting Dimension and Book Voucher
     2→
     3→## Trust Level
     4→- Trusted standard
     5→- Use directly for exact matches
     6→- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches
     7→
     8→## Exact Match
     9→- create one new free accounting dimension
    10→- create one or more new values for that dimension from prompt-provided names
    11→- then book one simple manual voucher
    12→- the scored voucher line is one ledger-account posting linked to one of the newly created dimension values
    13→- no supplier, customer, employee, project, VAT-specific, update, delete, or reversal flow
    14→
    15→## Do Not Use This Standard If
    16→- the task modifies or deletes an existing free dimension or value
    17→- the task needs a supplier-invoice, customer-invoice, payroll, project, or travel-expense flow
    18→- the voucher requires linked customer, supplier, employee, or project objects
    19→- the prompt gives a special balancing-account requirement that materially differs from the standard bank-line fallback
    20→
    21→## Standard Flow
    22→1. `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionName`
    23→2. `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionValue` once per requested value
    24→3. `GET /ledger/account?number=<target-account>,1920&fields=*`
    25→4. `POST /ledger/voucher`
    26→5. verify from the write responses
    27→6. stop
    28→
    29→## Payload Rules
    30→- on `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionName`, send:
    31→  - `dimensionName`
    32→  - `active: true`
    33→- `dimensionName` is validated at max length `20`; if the prompt-provided name exceeds that, treat the run as blocked instead of truncating it
    34→- on each `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionValue`, the minimal proven payload is:
    35→  - `dimensionIndex`
    36→  - `displayName`
    37→  - `active: true`
    38→  - `showInVoucherRegistration: true`
    39→- preserve the prompt-provided create order for new values, but choose the scored voucher link by exact returned `displayName`; same-day production runs proved the linked value can be either the first or second created value depending on the prompt
    40→- do not invent `number` or `position` on the dimension values for the standard path; sandbox proved Tripletex accepts the minimal payload and auto-assigns ordering
    41→- `/ledger/accountingDimensionValue/list` is `PUT` batch update, not batch create, so each new prompt-provided value still needs its own `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionValue`
    42→- reuse the returned `dimensionIndex` from the dimension-name create response; persistent sandbox assigned `2` in one run and `3` in later re-verification, not only `1`
    43→- on `POST /ledger/voucher`:
    44→  - set `voucherType: null`
    45→  - build a balanced two-line voucher
    46→  - use the resolved ledger-account ids, not `account.number` alone
    47→  - on the scored posting, attach the chosen value as `freeAccountingDimension1`, `freeAccountingDimension2`, or `freeAccountingDimension3` according to the returned `dimensionIndex`
    48→  - each posting MUST include `row` starting at `1` (not `0`); row `0` is reserved for system-generated postings and Tripletex will reject the voucher with `422` if any user posting lands on row `0`
    49→  - `date`, `description`, and `currency` on individual postings are optional; Tripletex auto-fills them from the voucher-level values
    50→- if the prompt gives only the target ledger account and omits the balancing account, the standard fallback is the existing bank account `1920`
    51→- for a zero-VAT manual voucher, omit `vatType` and send the same value in:
    52→  - `amount`
    53→  - `amountCurrency`
    54→  - `amountGross`
    55→  - `amountGrossCurrency`
    56→
    57→## Reuse From Write Response
    58→- from `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionName`:
    59→  - `value.id`
    60→  - `value.dimensionIndex`
    61→  - `value.dimensionName`
    62→- from each `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionValue`:
    63→  - `value.id`
    64→  - `value.displayName`
    65→- from `POST /ledger/voucher`:
    66→  - `value.id`
    67→  - `value.number`
    68→  - the returned postings with account ids, amounts, and the linked `freeAccountingDimension{1|2|3}.id`
    69→
    70→## Verification
    71→- default verification is zero extra calls after the voucher write
    72→- trust the dimension-name write response for the created dimension name and assigned `dimensionIndex`
    73→- trust the value write responses for the created value names
    74→- trust the voucher write response when it already proves:
    75→  - voucher id and number
    76→  - target posting account id
    77→  - target posting amount
    78→  - linked free-dimension value id
    79→- for the exact create-dimension-plus-two-values-plus-one-voucher task shape, this five-call flow remains the minimal realistic path because the lower-call number-only voucher shortcut is not valid
    80→
    81→## Minimal Voucher Posting Shape
    82→
    83→The true minimal required fields per posting are:
    84→- `row` (integer, starting at `1`)
    85→- `account: { "id": ... }`
    86→- `amount`
    87→- `amountCurrency`
    88→- `amountGross`
    89→- `amountGrossCurrency`
    90→- on the scored posting: `freeAccountingDimension{n}: { "id": ... }`
    91→
    92→Optional posting fields (auto-filled by Tripletex): `date`, `description`, `currency`.
    93→
    94→## Known Recovery Branches
    95→- if `GET /ledger/account?number=<target-account>,1920&fields=*` does not return `1920`, do one fallback `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*` and choose the existing invoice or bank account from that result
    96→- `GET /ledger/account?number=<target-account>,1920&fields=*` returns `account.number` as an integer; compare numerically when filtering the response locally, or you can falsely conclude the target account is missing and burn extra recovery calls
    97→- if dimension creation fails because all three free dimensions are already in use, treat the run as blocked by account state rather than guessing an update or reuse flow
    98→- if a persistent sandbox used for post-run research already has all three free-dimension slots occupied, do not back-port search/reuse workarounds into the scored create-only standard; that blocker is a sandbox-state artifact, not evidence against the fresh-account five-call path
    99→- if dimension creation fails because the free-dimension feature is disabled, treat the run as blocked by missing module or feature state unless the prompt explicitly instructs an activation step
   100→
   101→## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
   102→- `/ledger/accountingDimensionName`, `/ledger/accountingDimensionValue`, `/ledger/account`, and `/ledger/voucher` verified in `./openapi.json`
   103→- persistent sandbox re-verified on 2026-03-20:
   104→  - `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionName` returned `422` when `dimensionName` exceeded `20` characters
   105→  - the same endpoint also returned `422` with validation message `Maximum of 3 accounting dimensions allowed` when the persistent sandbox already had all three free-dimension slots occupied
   106→  - `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionValue` succeeded with only `dimensionIndex`, `displayName`, `active`, and `showInVoucherRegistration`
   107→  - `PUT /ledger/accountingDimensionValue/list` is batch update only, so it is not a lower-call shortcut for creating the requested values
   108→  - `POST /ledger/voucher` with `account: { "number": "7000" }`, again with `account: { "number": "6590" }`, later with `account: { "number": 6860 }`, again with `account: { "number": 7300 }`, and later with `account: { "number": 6340 }` failed `422` on `postings.account.name`, so number-only account refs are not the trusted fast path
   109→  - the id-based voucher write succeeded immediately after one decisive `GET /ledger/account?number=6590,1920&fields=*`
   110→  - later same-day re-verification with dimension `KS154433946` assigned `dimensionIndex=3`, created values `Innkjøp` and `Logistikk`, and returned the linked value on `freeAccountingDimension3.id` in the successful voucher write response
   111→  - a same-day voucher-path re-verification on existing sandbox dimension value `15253` confirmed that `GET /ledger/account?number=6860,1920&fields=*` returns both account rows with integer `number` fields and that the next `POST /ledger/voucher` succeeded with the linked `freeAccountingDimension1.id`
   112→  - the 2026-03-20 production run for exact prompt `Marked` / `Privat` / `Offentlig` / `6300` / `44950` succeeded on the first attempt with the standard five-call path and returned `dimensionIndex=1`, created value `Offentlig`, and a successful voucher write linked to that new value
   113→  - the later 2026-03-20 production run for exact prompt `Marked` / `Offentlig` / `Privat` / `7300` / `37250` also succeeded on the first attempt with the same standard five-call path and returned `dimensionIndex=1`, created value `Privat`, and a successful voucher write linked to that new value
   114→  - the later 2026-03-20 production run for exact prompt `Marked` / `Offentlig` / `Privat` / `6340` / `25200` also succeeded on the first attempt with the same standard five-call path and returned `dimensionIndex=1`, created value `Offentlig`, and voucher `608868584`
   115→  - a same-day persistent-sandbox re-proof for account `6300` reused existing dimension value `15253` only because the sandbox was already full on free dimensions, reproduced the same `422 postings.account.name: Kan ikke være null.` on the number-only voucher shortcut, then succeeded immediately after `GET /ledger/account?number=6300,1920&fields=*` with an id-based voucher write
   116→  - a later same-day persistent-sandbox re-proof for account `7300` hit the same full-dimension blocker, reused existing dimension value `15253` only for voucher-path verification, reproduced the same `422 postings.account.name: Kan ikke være null.` on the number-only shortcut, then succeeded immediately after `GET /ledger/account?number=7300,1920&fields=*` with voucher `608867443`
   117→  - a later same-day persistent-sandbox reflection for account `6340` hit the same full-dimension blocker `422 Maximum of 3 accounting dimensions allowed`, reused existing dimension value `15253` only for voucher-path verification, reproduced the same `422 postings.account.name: Kan ikke være null.` on the number-only shortcut, then succeeded immediately after `GET /ledger/account?number=6340,1920&fields=*` with voucher `608868815`
   118→- persistent sandbox re-verified on 2026-03-21:
   119→  - `POST /ledger/voucher` without `row` on postings → `422 Posteringene på rad 0 (guiRow 0) er systemgenererte og kan ikke opprettes eller endres på utsiden av Tripletex.`; Tripletex defaults unset `row` to `0` which is reserved for system-generated postings
   120→  - adding only `row: 1` and `row: 2` to the same payload → `201` with voucher `609065728`
   121→  - `date`, `description`, and `currency` on individual postings are confirmed optional; Tripletex auto-fills them from the voucher-level values
   122→  - the 2026-03-21 production run for exact prompt `Prosjekttype` / `Forskning` / `Internt` / `7000` / `32550` hit this exact trap: first voucher attempt without `row` → 422, retry with `row` → 201, scored 2.96/4 (6 calls, 1 avoidable 422) — perfect correctness (13/13, 6/6 checks) but suboptimal efficiency
   123→  - the later 2026-03-21 production run for exact prompt `Region` / `Sør-Norge` / `Midt-Norge` / `6540` / `5150` succeeded on the first attempt with the standard five-call path (0 errors), returned `dimensionIndex=1`, and linked the voucher posting to the newly created `Sør-Norge` value with voucher `609087109` — first perfect-efficiency run for this task shape
   124→  - same-day sandbox re-verification: `POST /ledger/voucher` with `account: { number: 6540, name: "Inventar" }` (no id) → `422 Internt felt (account) - Feltet må fylles ut.`; with `account: { id: 0, number: 6540, name: "Inventar" }` → same `422`; account id resolution via GET is mandatory and cannot be bypassed with number+name
   125→  - the later 2026-03-21 production run for exact prompt `Kostsenter` / `IT` / `HR` / `6590` / `38100` succeeded on the first attempt with the standard five-call path (0 errors), returned `dimensionIndex=1`, and linked the voucher posting to the newly created `HR` value with voucher `609093249` — second consecutive perfect-efficiency run
   126→  - same-day sandbox re-verification: `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionValue/list` with array body → `400 HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed`; `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionValue` with array body → `422 Verdien er ikke av korrekt type`; batch value creation is not supported, confirming 5 calls is the minimum for the 2-value task shape
