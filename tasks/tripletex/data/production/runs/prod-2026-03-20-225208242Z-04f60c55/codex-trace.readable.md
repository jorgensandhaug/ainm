Scored Tripletex run.
Follow ./AGENTS.md exactly.

Highest priorities:
- Get the final Tripletex state exactly correct.
- Use the fewest API calls possible.
- Avoid all avoidable 4xx errors.

Knowledge order:
- 1. ./trusted-standards/
- 2. ./task-playbooks/
- 3. ./openapi.json
- If this is an exact trusted-standard match, use it directly and do not re-check ./openapi.json.

Run-specific rules:
- Only interact with the Tripletex API by writing TypeScript and running it with bun.
- Put all API-interaction scripts only in this run scripts directory: /home/jorge/repos/ainm/tasks/tripletex/data/production/runs/prod-2026-03-20-225208242Z-04f60c55/scripts
- Do not place API-interaction scripts anywhere else.
- Reuse POST/PUT responses instead of doing follow-up GETs whenever possible.
- Ideal read count is zero. If a read is required, prefer one decisive GET with fields=*.
- Use only the provided base URL and session token.
- Authenticate with Basic Auth username 0 and password = session token.
- If the provided base URL already includes /v2, do not build URLs in a way that escapes back to the host root.
- If credentials are obviously fake, or the first attempted call returns invalid/expired token, treat the run as blocked instead of guessing.
- Do not ask questions. Do not talk to the user. Do only the task.

# Create Customer

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- create one new customer
- prompt directly provides customer identity fields
- no invoice, payment, update, delete, or lookup-heavy workflow
- at most one normal mailing address
- at most one generic email address

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- foreign organization number
- separate invoice email requested
- separate physical/visiting address requested
- task is update/delete/search-heavy
- prompt implies special invoice delivery setup

## Standard Flow
1. `POST /customer`
2. verify directly from `response.value`
3. stop

## Exact-Match Fast Path
- for the plain Norwegian create-customer shape, the winning API path is exactly one write:
  - `POST /customer`
- do not spend a pre-read on `/customer`
- do not spend a follow-up read on `/customer/{id}` when `response.value` already contains the scored fields
- do not spend scored-run time re-checking `./task-playbooks/create-customer.md` or `./openapi.json` when this trusted standard already matches exactly

## Payload Rules
- send only prompt-required fields
- normal default shape:
  - `name`
  - `email`
  - `organizationNumber`
- if one ordinary address is given, add only:
  - `postalAddress.addressLine1`
  - `postalAddress.postalCode`
  - `postalAddress.city`
- preserve prompt text exactly, including Unicode
- do not invent `physicalAddress`
- do not invent `invoiceEmail`
- localized generic email labels such as `Correo` and `E-mail` still map to `email`
- prompt language alone does not change this standard; French-, German-, and Spanish-language prompts with ordinary Norwegian customer fields are still the same one-call create path

## Reuse From Write Response
- `value.id`
- all returned scored customer fields
- returned defaults like `invoiceSendMethod` if later logic unexpectedly needs them
- ignore any sparse auto-generated `value.physicalAddress` link unless the prompt explicitly asked for a separate physical/visiting address

## Verification
- default verification is zero extra calls
- trust the `201` `{"value": {...}}` body
- only do a `GET` if the write response is unexpectedly missing a scored field
- if `value.physicalAddress` appears as a link-only object after sending only `postalAddress`, do not treat that as a missing-field problem

## Known Recovery Branches
- customer delivery validation if prompt explicitly implies EHF/invoice delivery constraints
- country/address consistency for foreign organization numbers

## Pitfalls To Avoid
- do not add duplicate-check logic for fresh-account create tasks
- do not invent `invoiceSendMethod`, `invoiceEmail`, or `physicalAddress` for the standard `name` + `email` + `organizationNumber` prompt shape
- do not treat the returned default delivery fields as a reason to fetch the customer again
- do not escalate to foreign-customer handling just because the prompt text is not Norwegian if the actual organization number and postal address are ordinary Norwegian values

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- endpoint family verified in `./openapi.json`
- repeatedly sandbox-proven as one-call create
- re-verified on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with `postalAddress`; the same one-call write returned the scored postal fields plus a sparse auto-generated `physicalAddress` link
- re-verified on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with only `name`, `email`, and `organizationNumber`; a single `POST /customer` returned customer `id=108246240` plus defaults `invoiceSendMethod=EMAIL` and `emailAttachmentType=ATTACHMENT`
- re-verified on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with `name`, localized generic email input, `organizationNumber`, and `postalAddress` (`Parkveien 49`, `4611`, `Kristiansand`); one `POST /customer` returned customer `id=108246353`, preserved all scored postal fields, auto-returned a sparse `physicalAddress` link, and still needed no follow-up read
- re-verified on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with `name`, generic `email`, Norwegian `organizationNumber`, and `postalAddress` (`Fjordveien 129`, `2317`, `Hamar`); one `POST /customer` returned customer `id=108248251`, preserved the exact postal fields in `response.value.postalAddress`, and still needed no follow-up read
- re-verified on 2026-03-20 in production for the German-language prompt `Grünfeld GmbH`, `886669445`, `post@grunfeld.no`, and `Kirkegata 87, 6003 Ålesund`; one `POST /customer` returned customer `id=108268199`, preserved the exact Unicode name and city, and still needed no follow-up read
- re-verified again on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with production-like German prompt semantics and unique payload `Grünfeld Reflection 201018 AS`, `post-reflection-201018@grunfeld.no`, `999201018`, and `postalAddress` `Kirkegata 87`, `6003`, `Ålesund`; the same single `POST /customer` returned customer `id=108268237`, preserved the exact Unicode name and city, auto-returned a sparse `physicalAddress` link, and still needed no follow-up read
- re-verified on 2026-03-20 in production for the French-language prompt `Colline SARL`, `939137599`, `post@colline.no`, and `Kirkegata 77, 4611 Kristiansand`; one `POST /customer` returned customer `id=108284978`, preserved the exact name, email, and postal fields, auto-returned a sparse `physicalAddress` link, and still needed no follow-up read
- re-verified on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with production-like French prompt semantics and unique payload `Colline Reflection c833b15d SARL`, `post-reflection-c833b15d@colline.no`, `999833115`, and `postalAddress` `Kirkegata 77`, `4611`, `Kristiansand`; the same single `POST /customer` returned customer `id=108285083`, preserved the exact postal fields, auto-returned a sparse `physicalAddress` link, and still needed no follow-up read
- re-verified on 2026-03-20 in production for the Spanish-language prompt `Río Verde SL`, `919234830`, `post@rio.no`, and `Solveien 5, 4006 Stavanger`; one `POST /customer` returned customer `id=108285940`, preserved the exact accented Unicode name plus email and postal fields, auto-returned a sparse `physicalAddress` link, and still needed no follow-up read
- re-verified on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with production-like Spanish prompt semantics and unique payload `Río Verde Reflection 017503 AS`, `post-reflection-017503@rio.no`, `999017503`, and `postalAddress` `Solveien 5`, `4006`, `Stavanger`; the same single `POST /customer` returned customer `id=108286045`, preserved the exact accented Unicode name and postal fields, auto-returned a sparse `physicalAddress` link, and still needed no follow-up read

# Common Endpoints

Verified against `./openapi.json`.

Use this as the exact endpoint-shape reference for the most common Tripletex resources.

## Customer
- `/customer`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/customer/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
  - `DELETE` delete
- Standard create prerequisite:
  - none
- Standard fast-path note:
  - for the exact one-customer create shape with prompt-provided `name`, `email`, Norwegian `organizationNumber`, and optionally one ordinary `postalAddress`, the canonical path is one `POST /customer`
  - no `GET /customer` pre-read and no `GET /customer/{id}` follow-up read are part of the trusted fast path
  - prompt prose language does not change that one-call branch; French-, German-, and Spanish-language customer-create prompts with ordinary Norwegian fields stay on the same `POST /customer` path
- Standard verification note:
  - `POST /customer` can return a sparse auto-generated `physicalAddress` link object even when the payload only sent `postalAddress`; verify the prompt-scored fields from `value` and do not add a follow-up read just for that link
  - when the prompt includes one ordinary mailing address, `value.postalAddress.addressLine1`, `value.postalAddress.postalCode`, and `value.postalAddress.city` can already prove the scored address fields
  - localized generic email labels such as `Correo` and `E-mail` still map to the same `email` payload field; they are not a reason to add `invoiceEmail`

## Department
- `/department`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create one
- `/department/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
  - `DELETE` delete
- `/department/list`
  - `POST` batch create
- Standard create prerequisite:
  - none
- Standard verification note:
  - for `POST /department/list`, trust `values[]` and the returned department fields; top-level wrapper metadata such as `fullResultSize` can stay `0` on successful writes
  - for exact multi-department create prompts, including multilingual prompts that only supply department names, the canonical path is one `POST /department/list`; do not add a discovery `GET /department` and do not split the task into repeated `POST /department` calls
  - 2026-03-20 production re-confirmed that the same one-call branch remained minimal for Norwegian prompts creating `HR`, `Salg`, and `Økonomi` and for `Lager`, `Regnskap`, and `Kvalitetskontroll`; the write response alone still proved correctness
  - same-day persistent-sandbox re-proof with `Lager Reflection cbae44a2`, `Regnskap Reflection cbae44a2`, and `Kvalitetskontroll Reflection cbae44a2` again returned the created departments in `values[]` while top-level `fullResultSize` stayed `0`

## Division
- `/division`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/division/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
  - `DELETE` delete
- Standard prerequisite note:
  - division is not part of the default employee-create fast path
  - resolve one existing `/division?count=1&fields=*` only when a live validation branch explicitly requires `employments[].division.id`
- Standard create note:
  - do not assume `POST /division` is a safe minimal name-only repair write
  - persistent sandbox follow-up on 2026-03-20 showed that `POST /division` with only `name` fails `422` requiring `organizationNumber`, `startDate`, `municipalityDate`, and `municipality`
  - for payroll no-division branches where the prompt does not provide those fields, a speculative division-create fallback is not part of the trusted minimum path

## Employee
- `/employee`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/employee/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
- `/employee/employment`
  - `GET` search employments
  - `POST` create employment
- Standard create prerequisites:
  - explicit `userType`
- Standard create fast-path note:
  - for the exact create-one-employee shape with prompt-provided name, birth date, email, and start date, the lower-call default is `POST /employee` first with explicit `userType` and nested `employments`
  - 2026-03-20 production re-confirmed that when that first write succeeds in a fresh account, the minimum safe path is usually `2` calls total: the `POST /employee` write plus one decisive `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=...&fields=*`
  - the 2026-03-20 production English run for `Thomas Harris` and later same-day Portuguese run for `João Rodrigues` re-confirmed that same `2`-call floor, while the same-session persistent sandbox still took the full repair ladder before the same verification read
  - do not default to `GET /department` before the first write; only branch into `GET /department?isInactive=false&count=1&fields=*` if the create fails with `422` where `validationMessages[].field == "department.id"`
  - if that department repair read returns no active department and department is clearly required, `POST /department` with a minimal name-only payload and retry the same employee create once
  - if the employee create then fails with `422` where `validationMessages[].field == "employments.division.id"`, do one decisive `GET /division?count=1&fields=*` and retry once with `division: { "id": ... }` inside the employment row
- Standard verification note:
  - a successful `POST /employee` can still echo `userType: null` plus `employments[]` as link-only objects without `startDate`
  - do not branch on the generic top-level `422 message`; current proven employee-create repair routing depends on `validationMessages[].field`
  - when the prompt scores employment start date, `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=...&fields=*` is the decisive verification read unless the create response unexpectedly already includes the actual `startDate`
  - do not try to save that verification read by trusting the write request itself on a start-date-scored task; that is still an unproven gamble rather than the trusted minimum safe path
  - prompt language and Unicode names do not change that path; mixed-language dates such as `5. September 1980` and names such as `João Rodrigues` still use the same normalized employee-create flow
- Standard payroll note:
  - `GET /employee?fields=*` can still return `employments[]` as sparse stubs with null `startDate`, null `division`, and empty-looking `employmentDetails[]`
  - for payroll-readiness checks, do one conditional `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=...&fields=*` only when the employee search response is too sparse to judge the payroll period or business linkage

## Salary
- `/salary/type`
  - `GET` search salary types
- `/salary/transaction`
  - `POST` create salary transaction
- `/salary/transaction/{id}`
  - `GET` read salary transaction
  - `DELETE` delete salary transaction
- `/salary/payslip`
  - `GET` search payslips
- `/salary/payslip/{id}`
  - `GET` read payslip
- Standard payroll prerequisites:
  - exact employee id
  - payroll-ready employee data
  - resolved salary-type ids
- Standard fast-path note:
  - for the exact one-employee payroll task shape, prefer `./trusted-standards/run-employee-payroll.md`
  - the winning successful path for a payroll-ready employee is usually employee read, conditional employment read only if needed, salary-type read, then salary-transaction write
  - for the exact task-12-like branch where the employee read shows one exact employee with `dateOfBirth=null` and `employments=[]`, the decisive gate is `GET /division?count=1&fields=*` before any salary-type lookup
  - if that division read returns one usable row, the lower-zero-risk path is `PUT /employee/{id}` with placeholder `dateOfBirth: "1990-01-01"`, `POST /employee/employment`, `GET /salary/type?count=1000&fields=*`, then `POST /salary/transaction`
  - if that division read returns zero usable rows and the prompt does not explicitly allow manual vouchers, stop blocked after those two calls; do not spend `GET /salary/type`
  - do not try to rescue that exact no-division payroll branch with a speculative minimal `POST /division`; persistent sandbox on 2026-03-20 showed that name-only create fails `422` and demand…1137 tokens truncated…t gives exact product names plus parenthetical numeric refs of unclear semantics, the lower-call product resolver is one decisive `GET /product?count=1000&fields=*` with local exact filtering by `number` and/or `name`
  - only switch from the direct `productNumber` query to the broader catalog read when those numeric refs are unclear semantics or the direct numeric query returns an incomplete/ambiguous subset
  - only spend `GET /product?ids=...` after the catalog read or numeric query if the earlier resolver still left the products unresolved
  - for explicit-VAT invoice tasks, do not assume that product search alone proves the VAT percentage; if the prompt scores exact VAT and the product read is sparse, do one filtered `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=...&fields=*` before the invoice write

## Project
- `/project`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/project/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
  - `DELETE` delete
- Standard create prerequisites:
  - customer id
  - often assignable project manager id
  - `startDate`
- Standard fast-path note:
  - for the exact create-one-project shape with an existing customer identified by `organizationNumber` and an existing manager identified by `email`, the winning path is usually `GET /customer?organizationNumber=...&count=10&fields=*`, `GET /employee?email=...&assignableProjectManagers=true&count=10&fields=*`, then `POST /project`
  - 2026-03-20 production re-confirmed that the same 3-call path is still minimal for a Portuguese prompt that omitted `startDate`; using the run date in the write payload succeeded directly
  - a second 2026-03-20 production re-confirmation for `Havbris AS` / `999148387` / `henrik.degard@example.org` kept the same 3-call floor for a Norwegian prompt that also supplied customer and manager names; the manager prompt name used `Ø` while the email local-part used ASCII `degard`, and that still did not justify any extra disambiguation read after one exact email hit
  - a third 2026-03-20 production re-confirmation for French prompt `Migration Lumière` / `Lumière SARL` / `849572458` / `nathan.dubois@example.org` kept the same 3-call floor; omitted prompt `startDate` still mapped to the run date, and the Unicode `è` in both project and customer names did not justify extra reads
  - 2026-03-20 persistent sandbox re-proof confirmed there is still no safe `2`-call shortcut for that exact shape: `POST /project` with nested `customer { name, organizationNumber }` can return `201` while leaving `customer=null`, and manager details without `projectManager.id` still fail validation
  - that same sandbox family now also has a precise failure signature for the manager-email-only shortcut: `POST /project` with `projectManager: { email: ... }` failed with `422 projectManager.firstName: Kan ikke være null.` plus `projectManager.lastName: Kan ikke være null.`
  - keep exact uniqueness checks local by comparing returned `customer.organizationNumber` and `employee.email`, and use prompt names only as local tie-breakers when they are provided
  - if the filtered reads already leave one exact-`organizationNumber` hit and one exact-`email` hit, reuse those ids directly; do not require the prompt names to match the returned display names
  - if the prompt omits `startDate`, default it to the run date in ISO format instead of omitting the field
- Standard search note:
  - for project-linked task shapes where the prompt gives project name plus customer identifiers, `GET /project?name=...&count=50&fields=*,customer(*)` can often resolve both the project and the linked customer in one read
  - for update-shaped project tasks that also score the existing manager, `GET /project?name=...&count=50&fields=*,customer(*),projectManager(*)` can often resolve the project, linked customer, and current manager in one read
  - when that expanded project search already leaves one exact `project.name` plus nested `customer.organizationNumber` and/or `customer.name` match, do not add a separate `GET /customer`
  - when that same expanded row also shows nested `projectManager.email` matching the prompt, do not add a separate `GET /employee` just to re-resolve the same manager id
  - for fixed-price partial-billing update tasks, that same expanded project read can also supply the existing `startDate`; reuse it on `PUT /project/{id}` unless the prompt explicitly asks to change the start date
- Standard verification note:
  - the successful `POST /project` response can already prove `name`, `startDate`, `customer.id`, and `projectManager.id`; do not add `GET /project/{id}` unless one of those scored fields is unexpectedly missing
  - in that exact create-project shape, do not add `GET /customer/{id}` or `GET /employee/{id}` after the filtered resolver reads; the search responses plus the project write response already prove the scored linkage

## Activity
- `/activity`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/activity/{id}`
  - `GET` read
- `/activity/>forTimeSheet`
  - `GET` resolve project activities available for one employee on one date
- Standard time-registration note:
  - for project hour tasks, prefer `/activity/>forTimeSheet` over a broad `/activity` search because it proves the activity is actually available on the project for that employee/date
  - `/activity/>forTimeSheet?...&fields=*` exposes the branch flag as `isChargeable`, not `chargeable`
  - if that read returns `isChargeable=false`, do not assume `projectChargeableHours` or a project-specific rate write can still make it billable
  - the 2026-03-20 production German `Windkraft GmbH` / `882984826` / `Sicherheitsaudit` / `sophia.schmidt@example.org` / `Design` / `18h` / `950` run re-confirmed that once `/activity/>forTimeSheet` already returns `isChargeable=false`, adding `GET /project/hourlyRates` would be wasted; keep the 7-call downstream floor `POST /timesheet/entry` -> `GET /ledger/vatType` -> `POST /order` -> `PUT /order/:invoice`
  - a same-session persistent-sandbox re-proof on 2026-03-20 with current-task arithmetic `23h * 1050` on the non-chargeable analog `codex.verify.1773957815637@example.org` / `Sandbox Hour Invoice Project 1774020541520` / `Prosjektadministrasjon` again finished in `7` calls on fresh date `2026-06-17`, returned `amountExcludingVatCurrency=24150`, and still had no safe reason to enter `/project/hourlyRates`
  - for prompt shapes that only score requested hours registration plus the customer-facing project invoice, a non-chargeable activity is still not an automatic stop condition: skip the doomed project-specific-rate write, register the hours, and use the manual project-linked order/invoice fallback

## Project Hourly Rates
- `/project/hourlyRates`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/project/hourlyRates/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
  - `DELETE` delete
- `/project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
  - `DELETE` delete
- Standard time-registration note:
  - only enter the hourly-rate branch when `/activity/>forTimeSheet` returned `isChargeable=true`
  - if `GET /project/hourlyRates?projectId=...` returns no holder for a chargeable project, create one with `POST /project/hourlyRates` before writing the employee/activity-specific rate
  - switching an existing project hourly-rate holder to `TYPE_PROJECT_SPECIFIC_HOURLY_RATES` and then creating the employee+activity rate are separate writes
  - `GET /project/hourlyRates?projectId=...&fields=*,projectSpecificRates(*,employee(*),activity(*))` can expose enough nested data to detect an existing exact employee+activity rate without spending a second rate-search call
  - when that same holder read already shows one exact employee+activity rate with the prompt hourly rate, reuse it and skip an extra write; if it shows the exact pair with a different hourly rate, update that existing specific rate once instead of blindly posting a duplicate

```

Exact trusted standard confirmed: one `POST /customer`, no pre-read, no follow-up read. I’m adding the run-local Bun script now with only the scored fields, then executing it and using the write response as verification.
