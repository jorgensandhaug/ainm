Scored Tripletex run.
Follow ./AGENTS.md exactly.

Highest priorities:
- Get the final Tripletex state exactly correct.
- Use the fewest API calls possible.
- Avoid all avoidable 4xx errors.

Knowledge order:
- 1. ./trusted-standards/
- 2. ./task-playbooks/
- 3. ./openapi.json
- If this is an exact trusted-standard match, use it directly and do not re-check ./openapi.json.

Run-specific rules:
- Only interact with the Tripletex API by writing TypeScript and running it with bun.
- Put all API-interaction scripts only in this run scripts directory: /home/jorge/repos/ainm/tasks/tripletex/data/production/runs/prod-2026-03-20-223925860Z-12c28001/scripts
- Do not place API-interaction scripts anywhere else.
- Reuse POST/PUT responses instead of doing follow-up GETs whenever possible.
- Ideal read count is zero. If a read is required, prefer one decisive GET with fields=*.
- Use only the provided base URL and session token.
- Authenticate with Basic Auth username 0 and password = session token.
- If the provided base URL already includes /v2, do not build URLs in a way that escapes back to the host root.
- If credentials are obviously fake, or the first attempted call returns invalid/expired token, treat the run as blocked instead of guessing.
- Do not ask questions. Do not talk to the user. Do only the task.

Task:
Opprett og send en faktura til kunden Nordhav AS (org.nr 876520427) på 7850 kr eksklusiv MVA. Fakturaen gjelder Analyserapport.

# Create And Send Customer Invoice

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- create one outgoing invoice
- send it as part of the same minimal flow
- invoice has one or more simple direct order lines
- prompt gives the customer identity directly or the customer is resolvable in one decisive read
- prompt does not require a specific send channel override such as a forced email address

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- prompt requires a specific send channel that is not already safely implied by known customer data
- prompt requires an existing-product lookup-heavy flow
- task is payment, reversal, or correction

## Standard Flow
1. if the prompt explicitly identifies an already-existing customer, resolve that customer in one decisive `GET /customer?...&fields=*`; otherwise, in the normal fresh-account variant, create the customer directly
2. if creating a new customer and the prompt gives no email or postal address, `POST /customer` with:
   - `name`
   - `organizationNumber`
   - `invoiceSendMethod: "MANUAL"`
3. resolve `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=<invoice-date>&fields=*`
4. `POST /invoice` and let the default `sendToCustomer=true` handle the send in the same write
5. only if that invoice write fails with missing company bank account:
   - `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*`
   - `PUT /ledger/account/{id}` with a checksum-valid unique 11-digit `bankAccountNumber`
   - retry the same `POST /invoice` once
6. stop

## Payload Rules
- include:
  - `invoiceDate`
  - `invoiceDueDate`
  - `customer: { "id": ... }`
  - `orders[].customer`
  - `orders[].orderDate`
  - `orders[].deliveryDate`
  - `orders[].orderLines`
- create lines under `orders[].orderLines`, not `invoice.orderLines`
- do not hardcode output VAT code `3`
- do not omit direct-line `vatType` just to save the VAT lookup; a successful write can still create the wrong VAT outcome
- for explicit no-VAT / `0%` direct-line prompts, still resolve the current account's filtered outgoing `0%` VAT row instead of assuming omission is equivalent
- for ordinary direct-line services explicitly priced excluding VAT / MVA, select an exact `25%` row from the filtered outgoing VAT result; if no such row exists, treat the task as blocked in that account instead of falling back to `0%`
- if creating the customer with no delivery/contact details, prefer `invoiceSendMethod: "MANUAL"` and let the invoice create do the send attempt

## Reuse From Write Response
- `customer.value.id`
- `invoice.value.id`
- `invoice.value.invoiceNumber`
- totals from the invoice write response

## Verification
- default verification is zero extra calls
- treat a successful `POST /invoice` with default `sendToCustomer=true` as the winning send path for this task shape
- do not add an automatic follow-up `PUT /invoice/{id}/:send`

## Known Recovery Branches
- if invoice creation fails with missing company bank account:
  - repair the existing invoice bank account and retry the same invoice write once
- if the prompt explicitly identifies an already-existing customer, use one decisive customer read instead of blind customer create

## Known Pitfalls
- do not spend `GET /customer` first on the normal fresh-account new-customer variant
- do not treat wording like `invoice customer <name> (<organizationNumber>)` as proof that the customer already exists; when the prompt only supplies business identity and the environment implies a fresh account, the winning path is still direct `POST /customer`
- do not branch into `PUT /invoice/{id}/:send?sendType=MANUAL` as the default path; sandbox reproduced `500` on 2026-03-20 while the same task shape succeeded through `POST /invoice` with default send behavior
- do not assume sparse `postalAddress` or `physicalAddress` links on the customer prove that `PAPER` send is available; sandbox returned `422 Faktura kan ikke sendes via PAPER`
- do not assume organization number alone proves EHF sendability; production returned `422 Faktura kan ikke sendes via EHF`
- do not treat a successful `POST /invoice` without `orderLines[].vatType` as proof that VAT is correct; persistent sandbox on 2026-03-20 accepted that lower-call write and created `amountCurrency == amountExcludingVatCurrency` (`28500`) on the same task shape
- for the exact one-line no-VAT service shape with prompt-only `name + organizationNumber + amount + description`, do not add a speculative customer lookup before the customer create; persistent sandbox re-verification on 2026-03-20 succeeded in `3` calls with `POST /customer`, filtered `GET /ledger/vatType`, then `POST /invoice`
- the same exact no-VAT branch also covers Portuguese wording such as `sem IVA`; the 2026-03-20 production run for `Porto Alegre Lda` / `842889154` / `Consultoria de dados` / `11200` used the same `3` calls and did not need `GET /customer` or `PUT /invoice/{id}/:send`
- for ordinary one-line service prompts that explicitly price the work excluding VAT / MVA, do not take the first filtered VAT row if it is `0%`; the safe branch is exact `25%` selection or a blocked conclusion for that account
- French wording such as `hors TVA` belongs to that same taxed ex-VAT branch, not the no-VAT branch. The 2026-03-20 production run for `Colline SARL` / `944164340` / `Service réseau` / `44750` succeeded in the canonical `3` calls, while the same-day persistent sandbox still exposed only `0%`, produced a wrong untaxed `44750` total when `vatType` was omitted, and rejected hardcoded `vatType.id=3` with `422`.

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- `/customer`, `/invoice`, `/ledger/vatType`, and `/ledger/account` verified in `./openapi.json`
- minimal create-and-send path re-verified in persistent sandbox on 2026-03-20:
  - `POST /customer` with `invoiceSendMethod: "MANUAL"` succeeded
  - `POST /invoice` with default `sendToCustomer=true` succeeded for the same customer
  - explicit later `PUT /invoice/{id}/:send?sendType=MANUAL` reproduced `500`
  - explicit later `PUT /invoice/{id}/:send?sendType=PAPER` reproduced `422`
- VAT handling re-verified in persistent sandbox on 2026-03-20 for the same one-line service invoice shape:
  - `POST /invoice` without line `vatType` succeeded but created a no-VAT invoice (`amountExcludingVatCurrency=28500`, `amountCurrency=28500`)
  - `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=2026-03-20&fields=*` returned only VAT code `6` (`0%`)
  - hardcoded line `vatType.id=3` failed with `422 ... Ugyldig mva-kode.`
- exact ordinary-service ex-VAT create-and-send shape re-confirmed across production plus sandbox on 2026-03-20:
  - production run `Snøhetta AS` / `871844062` / `Webdesign` / `20100` succeeded in the canonical `3` calls: `POST /customer` with `invoiceSendMethod=MANUAL`, filtered outgoing VAT read, then `POST /invoice`
  - the production invoice write already proved the intended taxed outcome with `amountExcludingVatCurrency=20100` and `amountCurrency=25125`
  - the persistent sandbox still exposed only VAT code `6` (`0%`) for the same date, so the exact same prompt shape would be blocked there for standard VAT rather than downgraded to `0%`
  - the French prompt variant `Colline SARL` / `944164340` / `Service réseau` / `44750` / `hors TVA` succeeded in the same canonical `3` calls in production and confirms that `hors TVA` must be normalized to ordinary taxed ex-VAT handling, not `0%`
  - the same-day persistent sandbox re-check on analogous org `944164341` again exposed only VAT code `6`, created a wrong untaxed `44750` total when `orderLines[].vatType` was omitted, and rejected hardcoded `vatType.id=3` with `422 Ugyldig mva-kode.`
- exact no-VAT direct-line create-and-send shape re-verified in persistent sandbox on 2026-03-20:
  - fresh-account-style branch: on the same one-line `22700` / `Design web` / `0%` shape, direct `POST /customer` with `invoiceSendMethod=MANUAL`, then `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=2026-03-20&fields=*`, then `POST /invoice` succeeded without any customer pre-read
  - the filtered VAT read returned only code `6` (`0%`)
  - the invoice write returned `amountExcludingVatCurrency=22700`, `amountCurrency=22700`, and an invoice number without any extra verification read
  - on the exact `Porto Alegre Lda` / `826870192` task identity, once that customer existed in sandbox, the existing-customer branch also succeeded with one decisive `GET /customer?organizationNumber=826870192&fields=*`, the same filtered VAT read, and the same invoice write
- exact Portuguese no-VAT direct-line create-and-send shape re-confirmed across production plus persistent sandbox on 2026-03-20:
  - production run `Porto Alegre Lda` / `842889154` / `Consultoria de dados` / `11200` / `sem IVA` succeeded in the canonical `3` calls: direct `POST /customer` with `invoiceSendMethod=MANUAL`, filtered outgoing VAT read, then `POST /invoice`
  - the production invoice write already proved the intended no-VAT outcome with `amountExcludingVatCurrency=11200` and `amountCurrency=11200`
  - persistent sandbox re-check on the analogous fresh-customer `842889155` shape returned VAT code `6` (`0%`) and the same `11200` / `11200` totals through the same `3` calls, again without any customer pre-read or explicit `:send` call

# Create and Send Customer Invoice

## Scope

Use for tasks like:
- create an invoice for an existing or new customer
- send the invoice after creation
- invoice has one or more simple order lines

For create-only invoice tasks that should stop before sending, use `./task-playbooks/create-customer-invoice.md`.

## Key Finding: The Winning Send Path Is Usually The Invoice Create Itself

For this task shape, do not default to:

`POST /invoice?sendToCustomer=false`

followed by:

`PUT /invoice/{id}/:send?sendType=...`

Persistent sandbox re-verification on 2026-03-20 showed a lower-call and safer path:

1. create or resolve the customer
2. resolve outgoing VAT
3. `POST /invoice` with the default `sendToCustomer=true`
4. stop

The same sandbox session also showed:
- explicit later `PUT /invoice/{id}/:send?sendType=MANUAL` returned `500`
- explicit later `PUT /invoice/{id}/:send?sendType=PAPER` returned `422 Faktura kan ikke sendes via PAPER`

For the common "new customer, no email/address in prompt" variant, the invoice create itself is the trusted send step.

## Key Finding: Fresh-Account Customer Identity Is Not The Same As Existing-Customer Proof

For exact create-and-send prompts that only give customer business identity such as:

- exact `name`
- exact `organizationNumber`
- no email
- no postal address
- no explicit wording that the customer already exists

do not spend a speculative:

`GET /customer?organizationNumber=...&fields=*`

first.

Persistent sandbox re-verification on 2026-03-20 showed the lower-call path for that fresh-account shape is:

1. `POST /customer` with:
   - `name`
   - `organizationNumber`
   - `invoiceSendMethod: "MANUAL"`
2. `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=<invoice-date>&fields=*`
3. `POST /invoice`

The same sandbox account then re-verified the existing-customer branch with:

1. `GET /customer?organizationNumber=...&fields=*`
2. `GET /ledger/vatType?...`
3. `POST /invoice`

So the pre-read is only part of the trusted path when the prompt explicitly implies an already-existing customer or the run context is not the normal fresh-account shape.

The same rule is language-agnostic for explicit no-VAT prompts. The 2026-03-20 production run for Portuguese `Porto Alegre Lda` / `842889154` / `Consultoria de dados` / `11200` / `sem IVA` also succeeded in the same `3` calls:

1. `POST /customer` with `invoiceSendMethod: "MANUAL"`
2. `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=2026-03-20&fields=*`
3. `POST /invoice`

So do not let prompt language push this shape onto an unnecessary existing-customer lookup branch.

## Key Finding: Company Bank Account Registration Is A Repair Branch

If `POST /invoice` fails with:

`Faktura kan ikke opprettes før selskapet har registrert et bankkontonummer.`

then the practical fix is:

1. Find the company bank ledger account with:
   `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*`
2. Pick the existing invoice account:
   usually account `1920`
   must have `isInvoiceAccount=true`
3. Register the bank account number on that account:

```http
PUT /ledger/account/{id}
{
  "bankAccountNumber": "12345678903"
}
```

This was verified in sandbox:
- invoice creation failed before this update
- invoice creation succeeded after this update
- not every 11-digit string is accepted in practice; use a checksum-valid unique 11-digit number

## Key Finding: Resolve VAT Type Dynamically

Do not hardcode invoice line `vatType.id = 3`.

Use:

`GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=<invoice-date>&fields=*`

and choose from the filtered result for the actual invoice date.

This was re-verified in sandbox on 2026-03-19:
- `POST /invoice` failed with `Ugyldig mva-kode.` when line VAT was hardcoded to `3`
- `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=2026-03-19&fields=*` returned only VAT code `6`
- invoice creation succeeded after using the dynamically resolved VAT type from that filtered result

## Key Finding: Omitting Line VAT Is A Fake Optimization

Do not try to save the `GET /ledger/vatType` call for a simple direct service line by omitting `orderLines[].vatType`.

Persistent sandbox re-verification on 2026-03-20 showed:
- `POST /invoice` without line `vatType` still succeeded
- the resulting invoice had `amountExcludingVatCurrency=28500` and `amountCurrency=28500`
- in that sandbox account, the filtered outgoing VAT result for the same date only exposed VAT code `6` (`0%`)
- hardcoding `vatType.id = 3` still failed with `422 ... Ugyldig mva-kode.`

So the lower-call omission path can silently create a no-VAT invoice instead of the intended taxable-service invoice. For this task shape, the dynamic filtered VAT lookup remains the minimum safe path.

For exact direct-line no-VAT prompts, the same rule still applies:

- do not omit `orderLines[].vatType`
- resolve the filtered outgoing `0%` VAT row that actually exists in the current account

Persistent sandbox re-verification on 2026-03-20 for `Porto Alegre Lda` / `826870192` / `Design web` / `22700` showed:

- `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=2026-03-20&fields=*` returned only VAT code `6`
- `POST /invoice` with that resolved `vatType.id=6` succeeded
- the write response already proved the intended no-VAT outcome with `amountExcludingVatCurrency=22700` and `amountCurrency=22700`

The 2026-03-20 production run for Portuguese `Porto Alegre Lda` / `842889154` / `Consultoria de dados` / `11200` / `sem IVA` and the same-day persistent sandbox re-check on analogous org `842889155` reconfirmed the same branch:

- direct `POST /customer`
- filtered outgoing VAT read returning code `6` (`0%`)
- direct `POST /invoice`
- no customer pre-read
- no explicit `PUT /invoice/{id}/:send`

For ordinary direct-line service prompts that are explicitly priced excluding VAT / MVA, the same dynamic rule becomes an exact `25%` selector:

- use the filtered outgoing VAT read
- choose an exact `25%` row, not the first returned row
- if the filtered result exposes only `0%`, treat the run as blocked in that account instead of downgrading the invoice to `0%`
- French `hors TVA` belongs to this taxed ex-VAT branch. Do not misread it as `sans TVA` / `0%`.

This was re-confirmed on 2026-03-20 across production plus persistent sandbox:

- the production run for `Snøhetta AS` / `871844062` / `Webdesign` / `20100` succeeded in `3` calls: direct `POST /customer`, filtered outgoing VAT read, then `POST /invoice`
- the French production run for `Colline SARL` / `944164340` / `Service réseau` / `44750` / `hors TVA` also succeeded in the same `3` calls and confirms the same taxed branch
- the production invoice write already proved the taxed outcome with `amountExcludingVatCurrency=20100` and `amountCurrency=25125`
- the persistent sandbox on the same date still exposed only VAT code `6` (`0%`)
- on that sandbox account, omitting `vatType` for the same `20100` / `Webdesign` line silently created `amountCurrency=20100`
- on that sandbox account, hardcoded `vatType.id=3` still failed with `422 ... Ugyldig mva-kode.`
- on the analogous sandbox probe `944164341` / `Service reseau` / `44750`, omission again created a wrong untaxed `44750` total and hardcoded `vatType.id=3` again failed with `422 ... Ugyldig mva-kode.`

## Important Constraints

- Do not assume there is a separate public company-level bank-account endpoint in `openapi.json`
- The public/spec-confirmed path that solved this was `PUT /ledger/account/{id}`
- Do not create a second invoice bank account with the same `bankAccountNumber`
- Duplicate bank account numbers trigger validation errors
- Prefer updating existing `1920` over creating a new invoice account
- Do not hardcode invoice/order-line VAT code `3`
- The authoritative candidate set for invoice lines is the filtered `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=...&fields=*` result on the invoice date

## Minimal Flow

1. Find or create the customer
   - for the normal fresh-account new-customer variant, skip the pre-read and `POST /customer` directly
   - if creating a new customer and the prompt gives no email or postal address, prefer `invoiceSendMethod: "MANUAL"`
   - only use `GET /customer?organizationNumber=...&fields=*` when the prompt or environment actually implies an existing customer lookup
   - prompt wording like `invoice customer <name> (<organizationNumber>)` is not, by itself, enough reason to spend that pre-read in a fresh-account run
2. Resolve a valid outgoing VAT type for the invoice date when the line VAT is not already safely implied by the resolved product/account setup
   - `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=<invoice-date>&fields=*`
   - use a VAT type that actually exists in that filtered response
   - do not omit direct-line `vatType` just because the write may still succeed; that can silently produce a no-VAT invoice
   - this also applies to explicit no-VAT direct-line prompts; resolve the filtered outgoing `0%` row instead of assuming omission is equivalent
   - for ordinary service prompts priced excluding VAT / MVA, require an exact `25%` row from that filtered result; if `25%` is absent, stop as blocked for that account
3. Create invoice and let the default `sendToCustomer=true` perform the send in the same write
   - include required dates
   - include `orders`
   - include `orderLines` inside the order, not directly on invoice input
4. If `POST /invoice` fails with the company-bank-account validation, repair that prerequisite once
   - `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*`
   - update the existing invoice account with `PUT /ledger/account/{id}`
   - retry the invoice write once
5. If you need exact line-level proof and the invoice write response is sparse, do one immediate `GET /invoice/{id}` with expanded `fields`

## Invoice Payload Notes

- `invoiceDueDate` is required
- `orders[].deliveryDate` is required
- `invoice.orderLines` is read-only in the schema
- create lines under `orders[].orderLines`

Example shape:

```json
{
  "invoiceDate": "2026-03-19",
  "invoiceDueDate": "2026-04-02",
  "customer": { "id": 123 },
  "orders": [
    {
      "customer": { "id": 123 },
      "orderDate": "2026-03-19",
      "deliveryDate": "2026-03-19",
      "orderLines": [
        {
          "description": "Analyserapport",

# Common Endpoints

Verified against `./openapi.json`.

Use this as the exact endpoint-shape reference for the most common Tripletex resources.

## Customer
- `/customer`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/customer/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
  - `DELETE` delete
- Standard create prerequisite:
  - none
- Standard fast-path note:
  - for the exact one-customer create shape with prompt-provided `name`, `email`, Norwegian `organizationNumber`, and optionally one ordinary `postalAddress`, the canonical path is one `POST /customer`
  - no `GET /customer` pre-read and no `GET /customer/{id}` follow-up read are part of the trusted fast path
  - prompt prose language does not change that one-call branch; French and German customer-create prompts with ordinary Norwegian fields stay on the same `POST /customer` path
- Standard verification note:
  - `POST /customer` can return a sparse auto-generated `physicalAddress` link object even when the payload only sent `postalAddress`; verify the prompt-scored fields from `value` and do not add a follow-up read just for that link
  - when the prompt includes one ordinary mailing address, `value.postalAddress.addressLine1`, `value.postalAddress.postalCode`, and `value.postalAddress.city` can already prove the scored address fields
  - localized generic email labels such as `Correo` and `E-mail` still map to the same `email` payload field; they are not a reason to add `invoiceEmail`

## Department
- `/department`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create one
- `/department/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
  - `DELETE` delete
- `/department/list`
  - `POST` batch create
- Standard create prerequisite:
  - none
- Standard verification note:
  - for `POST /department/list`, trust `values[]` and the returned department fields; top-level wrapper metadata such as `fullResultSize` can stay `0` on successful writes
  - for exact multi-department create prompts, including multilingual prompts that only supply department names, the canonical path is one `POST /department/list`; do not add a discovery `GET /department` and do not split the task into repeated `POST /department` calls

## Division
- `/division`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/division/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
  - `DELETE` delete
- Standard prerequisite note:
  - division is not part of the default employee-create fast path
  - resolve one existing `/division?count=1&fields=*` only when a live validation branch explicitly requires `employments[].division.id`

## Employee
- `/employee`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/employee/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
- `/employee/employment`
  - `GET` search employments
  - `POST` create employment
- Standard create prerequisites:
  - explicit `userType`
- Standard create fast-path note:
  - for the exact create-one-employee shape with prompt-provided name, birth date, email, and start date, the lower-call default is `POST /employee` first with explicit `userType` and nested `employments`
  - 2026-03-20 production re-confirmed that when that first write succeeds in a fresh account, the minimum safe path is usually `2` calls total: the `POST /employee` write plus one decisive `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=...&fields=*`
  - do not default to `GET /department` before the first write; only branch into `GET /department?isInactive=false&count=1&fields=*` if the create fails with `422` where `validationMessages[].field == "department.id"`
  - if that department repair read returns no active department and department is clearly required, `POST /department` with a minimal name-only payload and retry the same employee create once
  - if the employee create then fails with `422` where `validationMessages[].field == "employments.division.id"`, do one decisive `GET /division?count=1&fields=*` and retry once with `division: { "id": ... }` inside the employment row
- Standard verification note:
  - a successful `POST /employee` can still echo `userType: null` plus `employments[]` as link-only objects without `startDate`
  - do not branch on the generic top-level `422 message`; current proven employee-create repair routing depends on `validationMessages[].field`
  - when the prompt scores employment start date, `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=...&fields=*` is the decisive verification read unless the create response unexpectedly already includes the actual `startDate`
  - do not try to save that verification read by trusting the write request itself on a start-date-scored task; that is still an unproven gamble rather than the trusted minimum safe path
- Standard payroll note:
  - `GET /employee?fields=*` can still return `employments[]` as sparse stubs with null `startDate`, null `division`, and empty-looking `employmentDetails[]`
  - for payroll-readiness checks, do one conditional `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=...&fields=*` only when the employee search response is too sparse to judge the payroll period or business linkage

## Salary
- `/salary/type`
  - `GET` search salary types
- `/salary/transaction`
  - `POST` create salary transaction
- `/salary/transaction/{id}`
  - `GET` read salary transaction
  - `DELETE` delete salary transaction
- `/salary/payslip`
  - `GET` search payslips
- `/salary/payslip/{id}`
  - `GET` read payslip
- Standard payroll prerequisites:
  - exact employee id
  - payroll-ready employee data
  - resolved salary-type ids
- Standard fast-path note:
  - for the exact one-employee payroll task shape, prefer `./trusted-standards/run-employee-payroll.md`
  - the winning successful path for a payroll-ready employee is usually employee read, conditional employment read only if needed, salary-type read, then salary-transaction write
  - for the exact task-12-like branch where the employee read shows one exact employee with `dateOfBirth=null` and `employments=[]`, the decisive gate is `GET /division?count=1&fields=*` before any salary-type lookup
  - if that division read returns one usable row, the lower-zero-risk path is `GET /salary/type?count=1000&fields=*`, `PUT /employee/{id}` with placeholder `dateOfBirth: "1990-01-01"`, `POST /employee/employment`, then `POST /salary/transaction`
  - if that division read returns zero usable rows and the prompt does not explicitly allow manual vouchers, stop blocked after those two calls; do not spend `GET /salary/type`
  - if that division read returns zero usable rows and the prompt explicitly allows manual vouchers, skip `GET /salary/type` and branch straight into `GET /ledger/account?number=5000,1920&fields=*` plus `POST /ledger/voucher`
  - do not add `POST /employee/employment/details` by default in that repair branch; persistent sandbox on 2026-03-20 proved payroll can succeed without it for manual salary lines
  - do not add speculative `/salary/settings` or company-module activation reads to the default payroll path; only branch into feature-state investigation after a live `403` permission response from salary endpoints
- Standard verification note:
  - `GET /salary/payslip/{id}?fields=*` is enough for `grossAmount`, `amount`, and `specifications.length`
  - `GET /salary/payslip/{id}?fields=*` can still keep individual `specifications[]` as link-only objects
  - for exact line-level verification, use `GET /salary/payslip/{id}?fields=*,specifications(*,salaryType(*))`

## Product
- `/product`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/product/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
  - `DELETE` delete
- Standard create prerequisite:
  - exact prompt-required fields
  - if the prompt requires a non-standard or otherwise non-default exact VAT percentage, resolve a valid outgoing `vatType`
  - if the requested exact VAT percentage is absent from `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=...&fields=*`, treat product create as blocked in that account
- Standard create fast-path note:
  - for the exact fresh-account create-one-product shape with prompt-provided `name`, `number`, excluding-VAT price, and standard `25%` VAT wording, the canonical winning path is one `POST /product` with no explicit `vatType`
  - on that exact shortcut, verify directly from the `POST /product` response that Tripletex returned a `vatType` and the computed `priceIncludingVatCurrency` reflects `25%`; the 2026-03-20 `Softwarelizenz` / `7986` / `24900` production run again confirmed that one-write path with `priceIncludingVatCurrency=31125` and `vatType.id=3`
  - for exact `0%`, reduced-rate, or otherwise non-standard VAT prompts, fall back to one filtered outgoing VAT read followed by `POST /product`
  - do not re-check `./openapi.json` for an exact trusted-standard match, and do not add `GET /product` pre-reads or `GET /product/{id}` verification reads when the write response already proves the scored fields
- Standard create note:
  - `POST /product` without `vatType` can silently inherit an account default in some sandbox accounts; the persistent sandbox still auto-filled `0%` VAT code `6` on 2026-03-20 and produced `priceIncludingVatCurrency == priceExcludingVatCurrency`, so do not use that as the trusted fast path when the prompt scores exact VAT outside the exact fresh-account standard-`25%` shortcut
  - exact `0%` product prompts such as books still use the same rule: select the matching `0%` row from the filtered outgoing VAT result in the current account
- Standard search note:
  - `GET /product?fields=*` can still return `vatType` only as a sparse link object (`id`/`url`)
  - `GET /product?productNumber=...&fields=*` can return the matched identifier under `number` rather than `productNumber`; normalize both keys before deciding a direct numeric resolver failed
  - when the prompt clearly provides exact existing product numbers, the lower-call first resolver is one decisive `GET /product?productNumber=<a>&productNumber=<b>...&fields=*`
  - for invoice/order tasks where the prompt gives exact product names plus parenthetical numeric refs of unclear semantics, the lower-call product resolver is one decisive `GET /product?count=1000&fields=*` with local exact filtering by `number` and/or `name`
  - only switch from the direct `productNumber` query to the broader catalog read when those numeric refs are unclear semantics or the direct numeric query returns an incomplete/ambiguous subset
  - only spend `GET /product?ids=...` after the catalog read or numeric query if the earlier resolver still left the products unresolved
  - for explicit-VAT invoice tasks, do not assume that product search alone proves the VAT percentage; if the prompt scores exact VAT and the product read is sparse, do one filtered `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=...&fields=*` before the invoice write

## Project
- `/project`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/project/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
  - `DELETE` delete
- Standard create prerequisites:
  - customer id
  - often assignable project manager id
  - `startDate`
- Standard fast-path note:
  - for the exact create-one-project shape with an existing customer identified by `organizationNumber` and an existing manager identified by `email`, the winning path is usually `GET /customer?organizationNumber=...&count=10&fields=*`, `GET /employee?email=...&assignableProjectManagers=true&count=10&fields=*`, then `POST /project`
  - 2026-03-20 production re-confirmed that the same 3-call path is still minimal for a Portuguese prompt that omitted `startDate`; using the run date in the write payload succeeded directly
  - 2026-03-20 persistent sandbox re-proof confirmed there is still no safe `2`-call shortcut for that exact shape: `POST /project` with nested `customer { name, organizationNumber }` can return `201` while leaving `customer=null`, and manager details without `projectManager.id` still fail validation
  - keep exact uniqueness checks local by comparing returned `customer.organizationNumber` and `employee.email`, and use prompt names only as local tie-breakers when they are provided
  - if the filtered reads already leave one exact-`organizationNumber` hit and one exact-`email` hit, reuse those ids directly; do not require the prompt names to match the returned display names
  - if the prompt omits `startDate`, default it to the run date in ISO format instead of omitting the field
- Standard search note:
  - for project-linked task shapes where the prompt gives project name plus customer identifiers, `GET /project?name=...&count=50&fields=*,customer(*)` can often resolve both the project and the linked customer in one read
  - for update-shaped project tasks that also score the existing manager, `GET /project?name=...&count=50&fields=*,customer(*),projectManager(*)` can often resolve the project, linked customer, and current manager in one read
  - when that expanded project search already leaves one exact `project.name` plus nested `customer.organizationNumber` and/or `customer.name` match, do not add a separate `GET /customer`
  - when that same expanded row also shows nested `projectManager.email` matching the prompt, do not add a separate `GET /employee` just to re-resolve the same manager id
  - for fixed-price partial-billing update tasks, that same expanded project read can also supply the existing `startDate`; reuse it on `PUT /project/{id}` unless the prompt explicitly asks to change the start date
- Standard verification note:
  - the successful `POST /project` response can already prove `name`, `startDate`, `customer.id`, and `projectManager.id`; do not add `GET /project/{id}` unless one of those scored fields is unexpectedly missing
  - in that exact create-project shape, do not add `GET /customer/{id}` or `GET /employee/{id}` after the filtered resolver reads; the search responses plus the project write response already prove the scored linkage

## Activity
- `/activity`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/activity/{id}`
  - `GET` read
- `/activity/>forTimeSheet`
  - `GET` resolve project activities available for one employee on one date
- Standard time-registration note:
  - for project hour tasks, prefer `/activity/>forTimeSheet` over a broad `/activity` search because it proves the activity is actually available on the project for that employee/date
  - `/activity/>forTimeSheet?...&fields=*` exposes the branch flag as `isChargeable`, not `chargeable`
  - if that read returns `isChargeable=false`, do not assume `projectChargeableHours` or a project-specific rate write can still make it billable
  - the 2026-03-20 production German `Windkraft GmbH` / `882984826` / `Sicherheitsaudit` / `sophia.schmidt@example.org` / `Design` / `18h` / `950` run re-confirmed that once `/activity/>forTimeSheet` already returns `isChargeable=false`, adding `GET /project/hourlyRates` would be wasted; keep the 7-call downstream floor `POST /timesheet/entry` -> `GET /ledger/vatType` -> `POST /order` -> `PUT /order/:invoice`
  - a same-session persistent-sandbox re-proof on 2026-03-20 with current-task arithmetic `23h * 1050` on the non-chargeable analog `codex.verify.1773957815637@example.org` / `Sandbox Hour Invoice Project 1774020541520` / `Prosjektadministrasjon` again finished in `7` calls on fresh date `2026-06-17`, returned `amountExcludingVatCurrency=24150`, and still had no safe reason to enter `/project/hourlyRates`
  - for prompt shapes that only score requested hours registration plus the customer-facing project invoice, a non-chargeable activity is still not an automatic stop condition: skip the doomed project-specific-rate write, register the hours, and use the manual project-linked order/invoice fallback

## Project Hourly Rates
- `/project/hourlyRates`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/project/hourlyRates/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
  - `DELETE` delete
- `/project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
  - `DELETE` delete
- Standard time-registration note:
  - only enter the hourly-rate branch when `/activity/>forTimeSheet` returned `isChargeable=true`
  - if `GET /project/hourlyRates?projectId=...` returns no holder for a chargeable project, create one with `POST /project/hourlyRates` before writing the employee/activity-specific rate
  - switching an existing project hourly-rate holder to `TYPE_PROJECT_SPECIFIC_HOURLY_RATES` and then creating the employee+activity rate are separate writes
  - `GET /project/hourlyRates?projectId=...&fields=*,projectSpecificRates(*,employee(*),activity(*))` can expose enough nested data to detect an existing exact employee+activity rate without spending a second rate-search call
  - when that same holder read already shows one exact employee+activity rate with the prompt hourly rate, reuse it and skip an extra write; if it shows the exact pair with a different hourly rate, update that existing specific rate once instead of blindly posting a duplicate
  - do not rely on embedded `projectSpecificRates[]` inside the holder `PUT` as the only rate write
  - `POST /project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates` rejects non-chargeable activities with `422 activity.id: Ikke fakturerbar.`

## Timesheet
- `/timesheet/entry`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/timesheet/entry/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
  - `DELETE` delete
- `/timesheet/week/:approve`
  - `PUT` approve week
- Standard time-registration note:
  - a timesheet write on a non-chargeable project activity can still succeed while returning `chargeable=false` and `hourlyRate=0`

```

In real tasks, replace `6` with the VAT type resolved from the filtered `GET /ledger/vatType` response for the invoice date. Do not assume the same code is valid across accounts.

For create-and-send tasks, omit `sendToCustomer=false` unless the prompt explicitly requires a separate later send step or send-channel override.

## Sparse Response Trap

- `POST /invoice` can succeed while returning `orderLines` only as link objects with `id` and `url`
- do not treat that as a failed line create
- if the task requires exact line-level proof before sending, do one immediate:
  - `GET /invoice/{id}?fields=*,customer(*),orders(*,orderLines(*,product(*),vatType(*))),orderLines(*,product(*),vatType(*))`

## If You Still Need to Probe

- First test in sandbox if available
- Reproduce with one simple zero-VAT or standard-VAT line
- If invoice fails after bank-account registration, use the new validation message as the next branch
- Reuse returned IDs from write responses

## Proven Send-Channel Pitfalls

- Do not assume `PUT /invoice/{id}/:send?sendType=MANUAL` is the safe fallback for customers created without email/address; persistent sandbox reproduced `500` on 2026-03-20
- Do not assume sparse customer address links mean `PAPER` send is available; persistent sandbox reproduced `422 Faktura kan ikke sendes via PAPER`
- Do not assume organization number alone makes EHF available; the production run for this task shape reproduced `422 Faktura kan ikke sendes via EHF`
- Do not assume a successful direct-line invoice write without explicit `vatType` means the VAT is correct; persistent sandbox on 2026-03-20 accepted that shape and produced a no-VAT invoice (`28500` total on a `28500` ex-VAT line)
- Do not spend `GET /customer` first on the exact fresh-account shape that only gives `name + organizationNumber` for a new customer; the 2026-03-20 sandbox re-verification proved the lower-call path is direct `POST /customer`, then filtered `GET /ledger/vatType`, then `POST /invoice`
