Scored Tripletex run.
Follow ./AGENTS.md exactly.

Highest priorities:
- Get the final Tripletex state exactly correct.
- Use the fewest API calls possible.
- Avoid all avoidable 4xx errors.

Knowledge order:
- 1. ./trusted-standards/
- 2. ./task-playbooks/
- 3. ./openapi.json
- If this is an exact trusted-standard match, use it directly and do not re-check ./openapi.json.

Run-specific rules:
- Only interact with the Tripletex API by writing TypeScript and running it with bun.
- Put all API-interaction scripts only in this run scripts directory: /home/jorge/repos/ainm/tasks/tripletex/data/production/runs/prod-2026-03-21-135631200Z-647074c0/scripts
- Do not place API-interaction scripts anywhere else.
- Reuse POST/PUT responses instead of doing follow-up GETs whenever possible.
- Ideal read count is zero. If a read is required, prefer one decisive GET with fields=*.
- Use only the provided base URL and session token.
- Authenticate with Basic Auth username 0 and password = session token.
- If the provided base URL already includes /v2, do not build URLs in a way that escapes back to the host root.
- If credentials are obviously fake, or the first attempted call returns invalid/expired token, treat the run as blocked instead of guessing.
- Do not ask questions. Do not talk to the user. Do only the task.

Task:
Créez une commande pour le client Océan SARL (nº org. 859049788) avec les produits Session de formation (3206) à 4950 NOK et Conseil en données (9191) à 7700 NOK. Convertissez la commande en facture et enregistrez le paiement intégral.

Task shape: create order for existing customer, invoice it, register full payment. Checking exact trusted standard first, then I’ll script the minimal API flow in the run `scripts/` dir and execute it with `bun`.

# Create Order, Invoice, and Register Full Payment

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- create one order for an existing customer
- use one or more existing products already identified in the prompt
- convert that new order into an invoice immediately
- register full payment on that created invoice immediately
- do not send the invoice unless the prompt explicitly asks for it

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- the task also requires creating the customer or products first
- the task is project-fixed-price, on-account, subscription, reversal, or partial-payment specific
- the prompt is too ambiguous to identify the existing customer or products decisively
- the task explicitly requires sending the invoice

## Standard Flow
1. `GET /customer?organizationNumber=...&fields=*` if the prompt identifies the customer by organization number
2. `GET /product?productNumber=<ref>&productNumber=<ref>&fields=*`
3. only if that first product read does not resolve every product, do one fallback `GET /product?ids=<ref>,<ref>&fields=*`
4. only if both numeric reads miss and the prompt also gives exact product names, do one final decisive `GET /product?count=1000&fields=*` and filter locally
5. `GET /invoice/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*,debitAccount(*),creditAccount(*)`
6. `POST /order` with embedded `orderLines`
7. `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?invoiceDate=<date>&sendToCustomer=false&paymentTypeId=<id>&paidAmount=<seed>&paymentTypeIdRestAmount=<same-id>`
8. verify `amountCurrencyOutstanding=0` or `amountOutstanding=0` from the invoice write response
9. stop

## Payload Rules
- on `POST /order`, send:
  - `customer: { "id": ... }`
  - `orderDate`
  - `deliveryDate`
  - `orderLines[]` with:
    - `product: { "id": ... }`
    - `description`
    - `count`
    - `unitPriceExcludingVatCurrency`
- preserve prompt product names/descriptions exactly when they are part of the scored state
- when resolving `GET /product?productNumber=...&fields=*`, normalize both `number` and `productNumber` from the response; some accounts return the matched key under `number`
- do not insert an automatic `GET /order/{id}` just because `POST /order` can echo `orderLines=[]`
- the canonical exact-match path does not include an automatic `GET /ledger/account` preflight
- if this is likely the first outgoing invoice in a fresh-account run and you intentionally choose the hedge against the missing-company-bank-account `422`, use one proactive `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*` before the first invoice write
- if you take that hedge and the chosen invoice account already has a `bankAccountNumber`, skip the repair and continue with the same invoice write
- for the combined invoice-and-payment write, use one valid incoming `paymentTypeId`, a minimal positive `paidAmount` seed, and the same id as `paymentTypeIdRestAmount`
- `paidAmount=0` is not a valid shortcut here; live validation treats it as missing
- for ordinary NOK runs, `paidAmount=0.01` is a proven safe seed that lets Tripletex calculate the remaining full payment automatically

## Reuse From Write Response
- from `POST /order`:
  - `value.id`
- from `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice`:
  - `value.id`
  - `value.invoiceNumber`
  - `value.amountCurrencyOutstanding` or `value.amountOutstanding`
  - invoice totals if needed for proof

## Verification
- default verification is zero extra calls after the combined invoice write
- trust the invoice write response when it proves remaining outstanding amount is `0`
- do not add a follow-up `GET /invoice/{id}` unless the task explicitly scores expanded linked fields that the write response omits

## Known Recovery Branches
- if the first product-number lookup only partially resolves:
  - try one fallback `GET /product?ids=...&fields=*`
  - only then consider one final `GET /product?count=1000&fields=*` name-filter fallback
  - do not let a name-only match from the first product-number read count as resolution for a missing numeric ref
- if `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice` fails only with `Faktura kan ikke opprettes før selskapet har registrert et bankkontonummer.`:
  - `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*`
  - update the existing invoice bank account with `PUT /ledger/account/{id}` using the minimal payload `{ "bankAccountNumber": "12345678903" }`
  - retry the same `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?...` once
  - do not create a second order
- if the combined invoice-and-payment write rejects the seed-payment shape for an unexpected account-specific reason after the invoice already exists:
  - resume from the existing unpaid invoice instead of rebuilding the order
  - `GET /invoice/paymentType?...` only if the same run does not already hold a proven valid incoming payment type
  - `PUT /invoice/{id}/:payment?...` with the actual outstanding amount from the invoice object

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- `/order`, `/order/{id}/:invoice`, `/invoice/paymentType`, and `/invoice/{id}/:payment` verified in `./openapi.json`
- exact downstream fast path re-proven on 2026-03-20 in production and sandbox
- when the first `GET /product?productNumber=...` already resolves every product and no same-run `paymentTypeId` is cached yet, the exact-match path is usually 5 Tripletex API calls:
  - `GET /customer`
  - `GET /product`
  - `GET /invoice/paymentType`
  - `POST /order`
  - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice` with `paymentTypeId`, a minimal positive `paidAmount`, and `paymentTypeIdRestAmount`
- if the same run already holds a proven valid incoming `paymentTypeId` for the same company and currency, the path drops to 4 calls:
  - `GET /customer`
  - `GET /product`
  - `POST /order`
  - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice` with the combined prepayment parameters
- re-verified earlier on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox for customer `864062245` with product refs `6749` and `3048`; before the combined-prepayment improvement was proven, the downstream split-tail path completed in 6 calls, selected payment type `32813748` (`Betalt til bank` / debit account `1920`), and settled the invoice to outstanding `0`
- further persistent-sandbox verification on 2026-03-20 with customer `975687821` and product refs `4366` / `3402` proved the lower-call replacement path:
  - `GET /customer?organizationNumber=975687821&fields=*`
  - `GET /product?productNumber=4366&productNumber=3402&fields=*`
  - `GET /invoice/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*,debitAccount(*),creditAccount(*)`
  - `POST /order`
  - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?invoiceDate=2026-03-20&sendToCustomer=false&paymentTypeId=32813748&paidAmount=0.01&paymentTypeIdRestAmount=32813748`
  - the invoice write returned `amountCurrencyOutstanding=0` directly, so the extra `PUT /invoice/{id}/:payment` call was unnecessary
- same-day production re-verification on 2026-03-20 for the exact Norwegian prompt `Vestfjord AS` / `970769994` / `Nettverksteneste (3237)` / `Analyserapport (4609)` / prices `13450` + `14200` also finished on the plain 5-call path with no `/ledger/account` repair branch:
  - `GET /customer?organizationNumber=970769994&fields=*`
  - `GET /product?productNumber=3237&productNumber=4609&fields=*`
  - `GET /invoice/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*,debitAccount(*),creditAccount(*)`
  - `POST /order`
  - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?invoiceDate=2026-03-20&sendToCustomer=false&paymentTypeId=<resolved>&paidAmount=0.01&paymentTypeIdRestAmount=<same-id>`
  - the invoice write returned outstanding `0`, so no extra payment or verification call was needed
- same-day production re-verification on 2026-03-20 for the exact German prompt `Waldstein GmbH` / `975687821` / `Netzwerkdienst (4366)` / `Beratungsstunden (3402)` completed in the same 5-call path with payment type `36030207` and no `/ledger/account` repair branch
- that paired production+sandbox proof confirms the flow is stable but the incoming `paymentTypeId` is still account-specific; do not hardcode the earlier sandbox id `32813748` into production or another environment
- the same sandbox proof also showed that `GET /product?productNumber=...&fields=*` can return the matched product ref under `number` instead of `productNumber`; resolvers must normalize both
- additional production re-verification on 2026-03-20 for customer `989093630` with product refs `5981` and `6784` had earlier completed in the same 6-call split-tail path with no `/ledger/account` hedge, and the created invoice outstanding was `63000` even though the prompt ex-VAT sum was `50400`
- production re-verification on 2026-03-20 again showed that the prompt ex-VAT total can differ from the payment amount because payment must use the created invoice outstanding balance
- production reflection on 2026-03-20 also showed that when the first outgoing order invoice in the account would otherwise hit the missing-company-bank-account validation, a proactive `/ledger/account` preflight would have saved one Tripletex call and avoided the `422`
- later production reflection on 2026-03-20 also showed the opposite risk: turning that `/ledger/account` hedge into a default step would spend a sixth call on accounts where the plain 5-call exact path already works, so the hedge must stay conditional rather than canonical

# Common Endpoints

Verified against `./openapi.json`.

Use this as the exact endpoint-shape reference for the most common Tripletex resources.

## Customer
- `/customer`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/customer/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
  - `DELETE` delete
- Standard create prerequisite:
  - none
- Standard fast-path note:
  - for the exact one-customer create shape with prompt-provided `name`, `email`, Norwegian `organizationNumber`, and optionally one ordinary `postalAddress`, the canonical path is one `POST /customer`
  - no `GET /customer` pre-read and no `GET /customer/{id}` follow-up read are part of the trusted fast path
  - prompt prose language does not change that one-call branch; French-, German-, and Spanish-language customer-create prompts with ordinary Norwegian fields stay on the same `POST /customer` path
- Standard verification note:
  - `POST /customer` can return a sparse auto-generated `physicalAddress` link object even when the payload only sent `postalAddress`; verify the prompt-scored fields from `value` and do not add a follow-up read just for that link
  - when the prompt includes one ordinary mailing address, `value.postalAddress.addressLine1`, `value.postalAddress.postalCode`, and `value.postalAddress.city` can already prove the scored address fields
  - localized generic email labels such as `Correo` and `E-mail` still map to the same `email` payload field; they are not a reason to add `invoiceEmail`

## Department
- `/department`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create one
- `/department/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
  - `DELETE` delete
- `/department/list`
  - `POST` batch create
- Standard create prerequisite:
  - none
- Standard verification note:
  - for `POST /department/list`, trust `values[]` and the returned department fields; top-level wrapper metadata such as `fullResultSize` can stay `0` on successful writes
  - for exact multi-department create prompts, including multilingual prompts that only supply department names, the canonical path is one `POST /department/list`; do not add a discovery `GET /department` and do not split the task into repeated `POST /department` calls
  - `GET /department?name=...` is a containing search, not an exact-match resolver; persistent sandbox on 2026-03-21 returned `Drift sandbox 20260320-223143` for query `name=Drift`, so local filtering must still require exact `department.name`
  - 2026-03-20 production re-confirmed that the same one-call branch remained minimal for Norwegian prompts creating `HR`, `Salg`, and `Økonomi` and for `Lager`, `Regnskap`, and `Kvalitetskontroll`; the write response alone still proved correctness
  - same-day persistent-sandbox re-proof with `Lager Reflection cbae44a2`, `Regnskap Reflection cbae44a2`, and `Kvalitetskontroll Reflection cbae44a2` again returned the created departments in `values[]` while top-level `fullResultSize` stayed `0`

## Division
- `/division`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/division/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
  - `DELETE` delete
- Standard prerequisite note:
  - division is not part of the default employee-create fast path
  - resolve one existing `/division?count=1&fields=*` only when a live validation branch explicitly requires `employments[].division.id`
- Standard create note:
  - do not assume `POST /division` is a safe minimal name-only repair write
  - persistent sandbox follow-up on 2026-03-20 showed that `POST /division` with only `name` fails `422` requiring `organizationNumber`, `startDate`, `municipalityDate`, and `municipality`
  - for payroll no-division branches where the prompt does not provide those fields, a speculative division-create fallback is not part of the trusted minimum path

## Employee
- `/employee`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/employee/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
- `/employee/employment`
  - `GET` search employments
  - `POST` create employment
- `/employee/employment/details`
  - `GET` search employment details
  - `POST` create employment details
- Standard create prerequisites:
  - explicit `userType`
- Standard create fast-path note:
  - for the exact create-one-employee shape with prompt-provided name, birth date, email, and start date, the lower-call default is `POST /employee` first with explicit `userType` and nested `employments`
  - 2026-03-20 production re-confirmed that when that first write succeeds in a fresh account, the minimum safe path is usually `2` calls total: the `POST /employee` write plus one decisive `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=...&fields=*`
  - the 2026-03-20 production English run for `Thomas Harris` and later same-day Portuguese run for `João Rodrigues` re-confirmed that same `2`-call floor, while the same-session persistent sandbox still took the full repair ladder before the same verification read
  - do not default to `GET /department` before the first write; only branch into `GET /department?isInactive=false&count=1&fields=*` if the create fails with `422` where `validationMessages[].field == "department.id"`
  - if that department repair read returns no active department and department is clearly required, `POST /department` with a minimal name-only payload and retry the same employee create once
  - if the employee create then fails with `422` where `validationMessages[].field == "employments.division.id"`, do one decisive `GET /division?count=1&fields=*` and retry once with `division: { "id": ... }` inside the employment row
  - for the richer exact onboarding shape `employee identity + department + start date + percentage + annual salary + standard worktime`, prefer `./trusted-standards/onboard-employee.md` instead of this simpler employee-card standard
  - persistent sandbox re-proof on 2026-03-21 confirmed that this richer onboarding shape can persist the salary/worktime-related employment fields directly through nested `employmentDetails[]` inside the first `POST /employee`
- Standard verification note:
  - a successful `POST /employee` can still echo `userType: null` plus `employments[]` as link-only objects without `startDate`
  - do not branch on the generic top-level `422 message`; current proven employee-create repair routing depends on `validationMessages[].field`
  - when the prompt scores employment start date, `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=...&fields=*` is the decisive verification read unless the create response unexpectedly already includes the actual `startDate`
  - do not try to save that verification read by trusting the write request itself on a start-date-scored task; that is still an unproven gamble rather than the trusted minimum safe path
  - prompt language and Unicode names do not change that path; mixed-language dates such as `5. September 1980` and names such as `João Rodrigues` still use the same normalized employee-create flow
- Standard payroll note:
  - `GET /employee?fields=*` can still return `employments[]` as sparse stubs with null `startDate`, null `division`, and empty-looking `employmentDetails[]`
  - for payroll-readiness checks, do one conditional `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=...&fields=*` only when the employee search response is too sparse to judge the payroll period or business linkage

## Occupation Code
- `/employee/employment/occupationCode`
  - `GET` search profession/occupation codes
  - query parameters: `id`, `nameNO` (containing), `code` (containing), `from`, `count`, `fields`
- Standard lookup note:
  - the `code` filter is a substring-containing match, NOT exact or prefix
  - searching `code=4110` returns unrelated codes that contain "4110" anywhere in their 7-digit code (e.g., `3341103` ADJUNKT)
  - the reliable lookup for a 4-digit STYRK group code is by `nameNO` with the Norwegian occupation name
  - `nameNO=kontormedarbeider&count=1&fields=id` reliably returns KONTORMEDARBEIDER (id `2951`, code `4114105`) for STYRK 4110
  - the exact STYRK-only `2511` branch is NOT uniquely resolvable from `GET /employee/employment/occupationCode?code=2511...`; persistent sandbox on 2026-03-21 returned 19 exact-`2511` rows
  - occupation code ids are reference data and are the same across sandbox and production accounts
  - known hardcoded mappings (verified sandbox + production 2026-03-21):
    - `kontormedarbeider` → id `2951` (KONTORMEDARBEIDER, code `4114105`, STYRK 4110)
    - `salgssjef` → id `4930` (SALGSSJEF, code `1233105`, STYRK 1233)
    - exact STYRK-only `2511` contract branch → id `301` (AUTORISERT REGNSKAPSFØRER, code `2511102`)
  - on employee writes, send `occupationCode` by `id`, not by `code`
  - persistent sandbox on 2026-03-21 showed that `POST /employee` with `occupationCode: { code: "2511" }` or `occupationCode: { code: "2511102" }` returned `201` but persisted `occupationCode: null`

## Employee Standard Time
- `/employee/standardTime`
  - `GET` search employee-specific standard times (requires `employeeId` query param)
  - `POST` create employee-specific standard time
- `/employee/standardTime/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
- `/employee/standardTime/byDate`
  - `GET` resolve effective standard time for one employee by date
- Standard note:
  - this is the per-employee standard time endpoint — use this when the task says to configure standard worktime for a specific employee
  - the payload shape is `{ employee: { id: <employeeId> }, fromDate: "YYYY-MM-DD", hoursPerDay: <number> }`
  - do NOT confuse with `/salary/settings/standardTime` which is the company-wide standard time setting
  - sandbox verification on 2026-03-21 confirmed `POST /employee/standardTime` persists correctly with the employee link
  - production run on 2026-03-21 used `/salary/settings/standardTime` (company-wide) instead of `/employee/standardTime` (per-employee), which caused check 10 to fail

## Salary
- `/salary/settings/standardTime`
  - `GET` search standard times
  - `POST` create standard time
- `/salary/settings/standardTime/byDate`
  - `GET` resolve effective standard time for…584 tokens truncated…hers, skip `GET /salary/type` and branch straight into `GET /ledger/account?number=5000,1920&fields=*` plus `POST /ledger/voucher`
  - do not add `POST /employee/employment/details` by default in that repair branch; persistent sandbox on 2026-03-20 proved payroll can succeed without it for manual salary lines
  - do not add speculative `/salary/settings` or company-module activation reads to the default payroll path; only branch into feature-state investigation after a live `403` permission response from salary endpoints
- Standard verification note:
  - `GET /salary/payslip/{id}?fields=*` is enough for `grossAmount`, `amount`, and `specifications.length`
  - `GET /salary/payslip/{id}?fields=*` can still keep individual `specifications[]` as link-only objects
  - for exact line-level verification, use `GET /salary/payslip/{id}?fields=*,specifications(*,salaryType(*))`

## Product
- `/product`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/product/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
  - `DELETE` delete
- Standard create prerequisite:
  - exact prompt-required fields
  - if the prompt requires a non-standard or otherwise non-default exact VAT percentage, resolve a valid outgoing `vatType`
  - if the requested exact VAT percentage is absent from `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=...&fields=*`, treat product create as blocked in that account
- Standard create fast-path note:
  - for the exact fresh-account create-one-product shape with prompt-provided `name`, `number`, excluding-VAT price, and standard `25%` VAT wording, the canonical winning path is one `POST /product` with no explicit `vatType`
  - on that exact shortcut, verify directly from the `POST /product` response that Tripletex returned a `vatType` and the computed `priceIncludingVatCurrency` reflects `25%`; the 2026-03-20 `Softwarelizenz` / `7986` / `24900` production run again confirmed that one-write path with `priceIncludingVatCurrency=31125` and `vatType.id=3`
  - for exact `0%`, reduced-rate, or otherwise non-standard VAT prompts, fall back to one filtered outgoing VAT read followed by `POST /product`
  - do not re-check `./openapi.json` for an exact trusted-standard match, and do not add `GET /product` pre-reads or `GET /product/{id}` verification reads when the write response already proves the scored fields
- Standard create note:
  - `POST /product` without `vatType` can silently inherit an account default in some sandbox accounts; the persistent sandbox still auto-filled `0%` VAT code `6` on 2026-03-20 and produced `priceIncludingVatCurrency == priceExcludingVatCurrency`, so do not use that as the trusted fast path when the prompt scores exact VAT outside the exact fresh-account standard-`25%` shortcut
  - exact `0%` product prompts such as books still use the same rule: select the matching `0%` row from the filtered outgoing VAT result in the current account
  - the same persistent sandbox still omitted `15%` from `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=2026-03-20&fields=*`, exposed `id=31` only in the broader `/ledger/vatType?fields=*` catalog, and rejected `POST /product` with `vatType.id=31` as `422 Ugyldig mva-kode.`; if the filtered outgoing list omits the requested reduced rate, treat the task as blocked in that account
  - that same broad catalog also surfaced several `15%` rows (`11`, `31`, `551`, `556`), and the first percentage hit was incoming code `11`; never resolve exact-VAT product creates by taking the first broad-catalog percentage match
- Standard search note:
  - `GET /product?fields=*` can still return `vatType` only as a sparse link object (`id`/`url`)
  - `GET /product?productNumber=...&fields=*` can return the matched identifier under `number` rather than `productNumber`; normalize both keys before deciding a direct numeric resolver failed
  - when the prompt clearly provides exact existing product numbers, the lower-call first resolver is one decisive `GET /product?productNumber=<a>&productNumber=<b>...&fields=*`
  - for invoice/order tasks where the prompt gives exact product names plus parenthetical numeric refs of unclear semantics, the lower-call product resolver is one decisive `GET /product?count=1000&fields=*` with local exact filtering by `number` and/or `name`
  - only switch from the direct `productNumber` query to the broader catalog read when those numeric refs are unclear semantics or the direct numeric query returns an incomplete/ambiguous subset
  - only spend `GET /product?ids=...` after the catalog read or numeric query if the earlier resolver still left the products unresolved
  - for explicit-VAT invoice tasks, do not assume that product search alone proves the VAT percentage; if the prompt scores exact VAT and the product read is sparse, do one filtered `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=...&fields=*` before the invoice write

## Project
- `/project`
  - `GET` search
  - `POST` create
- `/project/list`
  - `POST` batch create
  - `PUT` batch update
  - `DELETE` batch delete
- `/project/{id}`
  - `GET` read
  - `PUT` update
  - `DELETE` delete
- Standard create prerequisites:
  - customer id
  - often assignable project manager id
  - `startDate`
- Standard fast-path note:
  - for the exact create-one-project shape with an existing customer identified by `organizationNumber` and an existing manager identified by `email`, the winning path is usually `GET /customer?organizationNumber=...&count=10&fields=*`, `GET /employee?email=...&assignableProjectManagers=true&count=10&fields=*`, then `POST /project`
  - for the exact ledger-analysis shape `find the three expense accounts with the biggest January->February increase, then create three internal projects`, the lower-call create branch is one decisive `GET /ledger/posting?dateFrom=2026-01-01&dateTo=2026-03-01&count=10000&fields=*,account(*)`, one `GET /employee?assignableProjectManagers=true&count=1&fields=*`, one `POST /project/list`, then one `POST /project/projectActivity` per created project
  - 2026-03-20 production re-confirmed that the same 3-call path is still minimal for a Portuguese prompt that omitted `startDate`; using the run date in the write payload succeeded directly
  - a same-day Portuguese production run for `Análise Porto` / `Porto Alegre Lda` / `996943305` / `lucas.oliveira@example.org` also stayed on that exact 3-call floor; the Unicode `á` in the project name was not a reason to add any extra resolver or verification read
  - a second 2026-03-20 production re-confirmation for `Havbris AS` / `999148387` / `henrik.degard@example.org` kept the same 3-call floor for a Norwegian prompt that also supplied customer and manager names; the manager prompt name used `Ø` while the email local-part used ASCII `degard`, and that still did not justify any extra disambiguation read after one exact email hit
  - 2026-03-20 persistent sandbox re-proof confirmed there is still no safe `2`-call shortcut for that exact shape: `POST /project` with nested `customer { name, organizationNumber }` can return `201` while leaving `customer=null`, and manager details without `projectManager.id` still fail validation
  - 2026-03-21 persistent-sandbox proof for the internal-project branch showed that even `isInternal=true` does not waive the manager requirement: `POST /project` without `projectManager` returned `422` with validation message `Feltet "Prosjektleder" må fylles ut.`
  - that same 2026-03-21 sandbox proof confirmed that `POST /project/list` successfully created three internal projects in one call when each row included `name`, `startDate`, `isInternal: true`, and `projectManager: { "id": ... }`
  - keep exact uniqueness checks local by comparing returned `customer.organizationNumber` and `employee.email`, and use prompt names only as local tie-breakers when they are provided
  - if the filtered reads already leave one exact-`organizationNumber` hit and one exact-`email` hit, reuse those ids directly; do not require the prompt names to match the returned display names
  - if the prompt omits `startDate`, default it to the run date in ISO format instead of omitting the field
  - do not assume a freshly created employee is already an assignable project manager; persistent sandbox follow-up on `2026-03-21` rejected `POST /project` with `projectManager.id: Oppgitt prosjektleder har ikke fått tilgang som prosjektleder i kontoen` for a just-created employee, so the assignable-manager gate is real
- Standard search note:
  - for project-linked task shapes where the prompt gives project name plus customer identifiers, `GET /project?name=...&count=50&fields=*,customer(*)` can often resolve both the project and the linked customer in one read
  - for update-shaped project tasks that also score the existing manager, `GET /project?name=...&count=50&fields=*,customer(*),projectManager(*)` can often resolve the project, linked customer, and current manager in one read
  - when that expanded project search already leaves one exact `project.name` plus nested `customer.organizationNumber` and/or `customer.name` match, do not add a separate `GET /customer`
  - when that same expanded row also shows nested `projectManager.email` matching the prompt, do not add a separate `GET /employee` just to re-resolve the same manager id
  - for fixed-price partial-billing update tasks, that same expanded project read can also supply the existing `startDate`; reuse it on `PUT /project/{id}` unless the prompt explicitly asks to change the start date
- Standard verification note:
  - the successful `POST /project` response can already prove `name`, `startDate`, `customer.id`, and `projectManager.id`; do not add `GET /project/{id}` unless one of those scored fields is unexpectedly missing
  - in that exact create-project shape, do not add `GET /customer/{id}` or `GET /employee/{id}` after the filtered resolver reads; the search responses plus the project write response already prove the scored linkage

# Create Order, Invoice, and Register Full Payment

## Scope

Use for tasks like:
- create an order for an existing customer
- use one or more existing products on the order
- convert that order into an invoice
- register full payment on the created invoice
- do not send the invoice unless the prompt explicitly asks for sending

Do not use for:
- create-only order tasks with no invoice/payment step
- invoice-send tasks where customer delivery/send method is the main concern
- update/delete/reverse flows on existing orders or invoices

Exact-match tasks should now prefer the trusted standard:
- `./trusted-standards/create-order-invoice-and-register-payment.md`

## Key Findings

- `POST /order` can create embedded `orderLines`, but the `201` response may still echo `orderLines=[]`
- do not treat an empty `response.value.orderLines` on `POST /order` as proof that line creation failed
- sandbox verification on 2026-03-20 showed:
  - `POST /order` with embedded `orderLines` returned `orderLines=[]` in `response.value`
  - `GET /order/{id}?fields=*,customer(*),orderLines(*)` on that same order returned the expected 2 order lines
  - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?invoiceDate=2026-03-20&sendToCustomer=false` on an order created that way succeeded directly
  - the invoice response returned `amountExcludingVatCurrency=20450` and `amountCurrencyOutstanding=20450`
  - `PUT /invoice/{id}/:payment?...` reduced the remaining outstanding amount to `0`
- additional production verification on 2026-03-20 showed:
  - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?...` can fail after a successful `POST /order` with `422` and validation message `Faktura kan ikke opprettes før selskapet har registrert et bankkontonummer.`
  - `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*`, then `PUT /ledger/account/{id}` on the existing invoice bank account `1920`, then retrying the same `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice` succeeded
  - therefore the recovery branch must resume from the already-created order; do not create a second order
- product lookup verification on 2026-03-20 showed:
  - `GET /product?productNumber=<a>&productNumber=<b>&fields=*` returned both target products
  - `GET /product?ids=<id-a>,<id-b>&fields=*` also returned both target products
  - therefore, for numeric product refs in the prompt, product-number lookup is a good first try and one fallback ID lookup is enough if needed
  - if the first `productNumber` lookup misses one ref, do not let a name-only match from that same partial response count as success; keep exact-name matching as the final fallback after both numeric reads miss
  - the same search can return the matched product ref under `number` instead of `productNumber`; normalize both response keys before treating the direct numeric lookup as incomplete
- additional production verification on 2026-03-20 showed two more traps:
  - prompt numeric refs in parentheses are not guaranteed to be Tripletex `productNumber` values or product IDs
  - `GET /invoice/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*,debitAccount(*),creditAccount(*)` can return the correct incoming payment type with `creditAccount=null`; in that account `Betalt til bank` with debit account `1920` was still the right payment type and successfully settled the invoice
- same-day production verification on 2026-03-20 for the exact German prompt `Waldstein GmbH` / `975687821` / `Netzwerkdienst (4366)` / `Beratungsstunden (3402)` confirmed the canonical 5-call path directly:
  - `GET /customer?organizationNumber=975687821&fields=*`
  - `GET /product?productNumber=4366&productNumber=3402&fields=*`
  - `GET /invoice/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*,debitAccount(*),creditAccount(*)`
  - `POST /order`
  - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?invoiceDate=2026-03-20&sendToCustomer=false&paymentTypeId=36030207&paidAmount=0.01&paymentTypeIdRestAmount=36030207`
  - that run needed no `/ledger/account` repair branch and the invoice write returned outstanding `0`
- same-day production verification on 2026-03-20 for the exact Norwegian prompt `Vestfjord AS` / `970769994` / `Nettverksteneste (3237)` / `Analyserapport (4609)` / prices `13450` + `14200` re-confirmed that same uncached 5-call path on a second prompt family:
  - `GET /customer?organizationNumber=970769994&fields=*`
  - `GET /product?productNumber=3237&productNumber=4609&fields=*`
  - `GET /invoice/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*,debitAccount(*),creditAccount(*)`
  - `POST /order`
  - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?invoiceDate=2026-03-20&sendToCustomer=false&paymentTypeId=<resolved>&paidAmount=0.01&paymentTypeIdRestAmount=<same-id>`
  - that run also needed no `/ledger/account` repair branch and the invoice write returned outstanding `0`
- paired with the same-day persistent-sandbox proof for the same customer/product refs, this also confirmed that `paymentTypeId` is environment-specific: sandbox used `32813748`, production used `36030207`; keep resolving `/invoice/paymentType` dynamically unless the same run already holds a proven reusable id
- persistent-sandbox verification on 2026-03-20 showed a lower-call replacement for the old split invoice/payment tail:
  - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice` accepts `paymentTypeId`, `paidAmount`, and `paymentTypeIdRestAmount`
  - `paidAmount=0` was rejected as effectively missing even when `paymentTypeId` was present
  - `paidAmount=0.01` plus the same id as `paymentTypeIdRestAmount` settled the full NOK invoice in that same invoice write
  - therefore the extra `PUT /invoice/{id}/:payment` call is unnecessary on this exact task shape unless the combined prepayment branch fails
- later production reflection on 2026-03-20 showed one more efficiency trap:
  - turning the `/ledger/account` bank-account hedge into an automatic preflight on this exact task shape spends a sixth Tripletex call on accounts where the plain 5-call path already works
  - keep `/ledger/account` as a conditional hedge or repair branch, not as the default exact-match path
- additional production verification on 2026-03-20 also showed the older split-tail exact-match path before the combined-prepayment improvement:
  - one successful run completed with 6 Tripletex API calls after local spec confirmation
  - `GET /customer?organizationNumber=...&fields=*`
  - `GET /product?productNumber=<a>&productNumber=<b>&fields=*` already returned both target products, so no fallback `/product?ids=...` read was needed
  - `POST /order`
  - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?invoiceDate=2026-03-20&sendToCustomer=false`
  - `GET /invoice/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*,debitAccount(*),creditAccount(*)`
  - `PUT /invoice/{id}/:payment?...`
  - the prompt line-price sum excluding VAT was `56350`, but the actual payment amount from the invoice response was `70437.5`; this confirmed again that payment must use the invoice outstanding amount, not the prompt ex-VAT total
- another production verification on 2026-03-20 confirmed the same exact-match path again:
  - `GET /customer?organizationNumber=911511053&fields=*`
  - `GET /product?productNumber=7579&productNumber=2292&fields=*`
  - `POST /order`
  - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?invoiceDate=2026-03-20&sendToCustomer=false`
  - `GET /invoice/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*,debitAccount(*),creditAccount(*)`
  - `PUT /invoice/{id}/:payment?...`
  - the prompt line-price sum excluding VAT was `26450`, but the actual payment amount from the invoice response was `33062.5`; `Betalt til bank` again settled the invoice to `0`
- persistent-sandbox re-verification on 2026-03-20 confirmed the same downstream exact-match path for customer `864062245` and products `6749` / `3048` once those entities existed in the sandbox:
  - `GET /customer?organizationNumber=864062245&fields=*`
  - `GET /product?productNumber=6749&productNumber=3048&fields=*`
  - `POST /order`
  - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?invoiceDate=2026-03-20&sendToCustomer=false`
  - `GET /invoice/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*,debitAccount(*),creditAccount(*)`
  - `PUT /invoice/{id}/:payment?...`
  - the invoice response exposed `paidAmount=12650`, payment type `32813748` (`Betalt til bank` / debit account `1920`), and the payment write settled the invoice to `0`

- additional production verification on 2026-03-20 confirmed the same exact-match path for customer `989093630` and products `5981` / `6784`:
  - `GET /customer?organizationNumber=989093630&fields=*`
  - `GET /product?productNumber=5981&productNumber=6784&fields=*`
  - `POST /order`
  - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?invoiceDate=2026-03-20&sendToCustomer=false`
  - `GET /invoice/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*,debitAccount(*),creditAccount(*)`
  - `PUT /invoice/{id}/:payment?...`
  - the prompt line-price sum excluding VAT was `50400`, but the actual payment amount from the invoice response was `63000`; this exact Spanish-language prompt again confirmed that payment must use invoice outstanding, not prompt arithmetic

## Minimal Flow

1. Confirm these operations in `./openapi.json`
   - `GET /customer`
   - `GET /product`
   - `GET /invoice/paymentType`
   - `POST /order`
   - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice`
2. Resolve the customer
   - usually `GET /customer?organizationNumber=...&fields=*`
3. Resolve the products from prompt refs
   - first try `GET /product?productNumber=<ref>&productNumber=<ref>&fields=*`
   - if that does not uniquely resolve the products, do one fallback `GET /product?ids=<ref>,<ref>&fields=*`
   - if both numeric lookups fail and the prompt also gives exact product names, do one final decisive fallback `GET /product?count=1000&fields=*` and filter locally by exact prompt names
4. Resolve one usable incoming payment type
   - `GET /invoice/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*,debitAccount(*),creditAccount(*)`
   - prefer a bank-style incoming payment type whose debit account is `19xx`
   - if available, prefer `isBankAccount=true` or `isInvoiceAccount=true` on that debit account
   - do not reject the candidate just because `creditAccount` is `null`
5. Create the order with embedded lines
   - `POST /order`
   - send `customer`, `orderDate`, `deliveryDate`
   - embed `orderLines` with `product: { id }`, `description`, `count`, and the requested unit price
6. Convert the order into an invoice and settle it in the same write
   - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?invoiceDate=<date>&sendToCustomer=false&paymentTypeId=<id>&paidAmount=<seed>&paymentTypeIdRestAmount=<same-id>`
   - for ordinary NOK runs, `paidAmount=0.01` is the proven seed
   - do not use `paidAmount=0`; sandbox validation treated it as missing
7. Only if that invoice write fails with the company-bank-account validation, repair that prerequisite and retry the same order once
   - `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*`
   - choose the existing invoice bank account, usually `1920` / `isInvoiceAccount=true`
   - `PUT /ledger/account/{id}` with the minimal payload `{ "bankAccountNumber": "12345678903" }`
   - retry `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?...` on the same order
8. Reuse the invoice write response
   - verify `amountCurrencyOutstanding` first, otherwise `amountOutstanding`
   - use invoice totals/lines in that response as verification where available
9. Stop when remaining outstanding amount is `0`

## Exact-Match Fast Path

- For a prompt that already identifies:
  - the existing customer by organization number
  - the existing products by numeric refs
  - the order line prices
  - the need to invoice and fully pay immediately
- the winning path is usually 5 Tripletex API calls when the first product-number read succeeds and the run does not already hold a reusable incoming `paymentTypeId`:
  1. `GET /customer?organizationNumber=...&fields=*`
  2. `GET /product?productNumber=<ref>&productNumber=<ref>&fields=*`
  3. if that misses, `GET /product?ids=<ref>,<ref>&fields=*`
  4. only if both numeric lookups miss and the prompt also gives exact product names, `GET /product?count=1000&fields=*` and filter locally by exact names
  5. `GET /invoice/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*,debitAccount(*),creditAccount(*)`
  6. `POST /order` with embedded `orderLines`
  7. `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?invoiceDate=<date>&sendToCustomer=false&paymentTypeId=<id>&paidAmount=<seed>&paymentTypeIdRestAmount=<same-id>`
- if the same run already holds a proven valid incoming `paymentTypeId` for the same company and currency, the same exact task drops to 4 downstream calls by skipping step 5
- Do not insert an automatic `GET /order/{id}` just because `POST /order` echoed empty `orderLines`
- Do not insert an automatic `GET /ledger/account` before the first invoice write; on this exact task shape that turns the canonical 5-call path into a 6-call hedge
- If `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice` fails only because the company bank account number is missing, repair `/ledger/account` and retry the same order instead of creating a new one
- If the invoice response already proves the charged lines/totals and outstanding amount, that same write response is enough; do not automatically split into a later payment write

## Order Payload Notes

- Use the `Order` schema referenced by `POST /order`
- a safe embedded-line shape is:

```json
{
  "customer": { "id": 123 },
  "orderDate": "2026-03-20",
  "deliveryDate": "2026-03-20",
  "orderLines": [
    {
      "product": { "id": 456 },
      "description": "Training session",
      "count": 1,
      "unitPriceExcludingVatCurrency": 5700
    },
    {
      "product": { "id": 789 },
      "description": "Consulting hours",
      "count": 1,
      "unitPriceExcludingVatCurrency": 14750
    }
  ]
}
```

- if the account/product setup requires it, include a valid `vatType` on the order line
- when you already resolved products from `GET /product?fields=*`, reuse the returned product IDs directly

## Response Shape Trap

- `POST /order` may not be a reliable verifier for embedded line creation
- specifically, the write response can contain:

```json
{
  "value": {
    "id": 401954042,
    "orderLines": []
  }
}
```

- even though the order actually contains lines and can be invoiced immediately
- do not branch into a corrective rewrite just because that field is empty
- only add `GET /order/{id}?fields=*,orderLines(*)` if you truly need decisive pre-invoice verification

## Product Resolution Rules

- When the prompt names existing products with numeric refs in parentheses, try product-number resolution first
- Use:
  - `GET /product?productNumber=<ref>&productNumber=<ref>&fields=*`
- If that first read already returns both target products, stop there and reuse those IDs directly
- normalize both `number` and `productNumber` from the returned product objects before deciding a ref is missing
- If that does not uniquely resolve the products, do one fallback:
  - `GET /product?ids=<ref>,<ref>&fields=*`
- If both numeric reads fail and the prompt also gives exact product names, one final decisive fallback is allowed:
  - `GET /product?count=1000&fields=*`
  - filter locally by exact prompt names
- Do not let a name-only match from the initial `productNumber` response count as success for a still-missing numeric ref
- Do not spray multiple exploratory `/product` reads after that final fallback
- Reuse the resolved product objects for IDs and any needed VAT context

## Payment Rules

- For `GET /invoice/paymentType`, normalize account numbers before prefix checks
- Prefer a `19xx` debit account that is also flagged as `isBankAccount=true` or `isInvoiceAccount=true`
- Do not require a `15xx` `creditAccount`; the correct incoming payment type may return `creditAccount=null`
- For the lower-call exact-match path, pay during `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice` instead of using a separate `PUT /invoice/{id}/:payment`
- Use the same resolved incoming `paymentTypeId` as both `paymentTypeId` and `paymentTypeIdRestAmount`
- Seed `paidAmount` with the smallest positive amount accepted for the invoice currency; `0.01` is proven for ordinary NOK runs
- Do not use `paidAmount=0`; sandbox validation rejected it as effectively missing
- Only fall back to a later standalone invoice-payment write if the combined invoice-prepayment write fails for an account-specific reason

## Recovery Rule After Partial Success

- If `POST /order` succeeded but `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice` failed only because the company bank account number is missing:
  - do `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*`
  - update the existing invoice bank account with `PUT /ledger/account/{id}`
  - retry the same `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?...`
  - do not restart from `POST /order`
- If `POST /order` and `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice` already succeeded but the combined prepayment branch did not settle the invoice, do not start over with a new order
- Locate the existing unpaid invoice with one decisive read such as:
  - `GET /invoice?customerId=<id>&invoiceDateFrom=<date>&invoiceDateTo=<next-date>&count=1000&fields=*,customer(*),orderLines(*,product(*)),orders(*,orderLines(*,product(*)))`
- Filter locally by:
  - positive outstanding amount
  - exact ex-VAT total
  - exact prompt line descriptions or product refs
- Then finish with:
  - `GET /invoice/paymentType?...`
  - `PUT /invoice/{id}/:payment?...`
- This avoids duplicating orders/invoices after a late-step failure

## Verification Shape

- `POST /order`:
  - trust the returned `id`
  - do not over-trust `orderLines`
- `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice`:
  - expect `ResponseWrapperInvoice`
  - reuse `id`, `invoiceNumber`, invoice totals, and outstanding amount

```

I have enough context. Next step is one script in the run `scripts/` dir that does: resolve customer, resolve products, resolve incoming payment type, create order, invoice+pay, and only branch into the bank-account repair if that exact validation error appears.

Script is written. I’m executing it now with `bun`; if Tripletex rejects only the missing-company-bank-account prerequisite, the script will repair that single prerequisite and retry once on the same order.
