# Register Project Hours and Create Project Invoice

## Scope

Use for tasks like:
- register hours on an existing employee in an existing project
- use a specific existing project activity
- apply a prompt-given hourly rate
- create an unsent project invoice to the linked customer

Do not use for:
- fixed-price or on-account project billing
- travel-expense or re-invoicing-heavy project tasks
- cases where the employee, project, or customer must also be created from scratch

## Verified Findings

Persistent-sandbox verification on 2026-03-20 showed:
- `GET /activity/>forTimeSheet?...&fields=*` exposes the branch flag as `isChargeable`, not `chargeable`
- `GET /project?name=...&count=50&fields=*,customer(*)` returned enough expanded customer data to identify the linked customer without a separate `GET /customer`
- `GET /project/hourlyRates?projectId=...&count=100&fields=*,projectSpecificRates(*,employee(*),activity(*))` returned enough nested data to identify an already-existing exact employee+activity rate and its `hourlyRate` without a second rate-search call
- on a newly created analog project with no hourly-rate holder yet, `POST /project/hourlyRates` with `project`, `startDate`, and `hourlyRateModel: "TYPE_PROJECT_SPECIFIC_HOURLY_RATES"` created the missing holder, after which `POST /project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates` and `POST /timesheet/entry` succeeded normally
- `PUT /project/hourlyRates/{id}` can switch an existing project hourly-rate holder from `TYPE_FIXED_HOURLY_RATE` to `TYPE_PROJECT_SPECIFIC_HOURLY_RATES`
- after that model switch, `POST /project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates` with:
  - `projectHourlyRate`
  - `employee`
  - `activity`
  - `hourlyRate`
  succeeded for a chargeable activity and the next `POST /timesheet/entry` returned:
  - `chargeable=true`
  - `hourlyRate=<prompt rate>`
- the same `POST /project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates` failed on a non-chargeable activity with:
  - `422 activity.id: Ikke fakturerbar.`
- `POST /timesheet/entry` on a non-chargeable project activity still succeeded even with `projectChargeableHours`, but the write response kept:
  - `chargeable=false`
  - `hourlyRate=0`
- for the exact sandbox analog `codex.verify.1773957815637@example.org` + `Sandbox Hour Invoice Project 1774020541520` + `Prosjektadministrasjon` + rate `1750`, the 7-call branch `GET /employee` -> `GET /project` -> `GET /activity/>forTimeSheet` -> `POST /timesheet/entry` -> `GET /ledger/vatType` -> `POST /order` -> `PUT /order/:invoice` succeeded, with `activity.isChargeable=false`, `timesheet.chargeable=false`, and `timesheet.hourlyRate=0`
- a same-session persistent-sandbox re-proof on 2026-03-20 with current-task arithmetic `23` hours at `1050` on that same non-chargeable analog again finished in `7` calls on fresh date `2026-06-17` and returned `amountExcludingVatCurrency=24150`
- a same-session persistent-sandbox re-proof on 2026-03-20 with current-task arithmetic `5` hours at `1400` on that same non-chargeable analog showed that omitting the manual project-order-line `vatType` can collapse the branch to `6` calls and still return `amountExcludingVatCurrency=7000` / `amountCurrencyOutstanding=7000` when the account exposes only outgoing VAT row `id=6` (`0%`)
- that shortcut is still not the trusted scored-run default for taxable accounts; same-day direct-line invoice/order proofs elsewhere in the corpus still showed that omitted `vatType` can silently create a wrong no-VAT result on `0%`-only accounts
- a same-day persistent-sandbox re-proof with that same analog employee/project/activity and prompt-like `18` hours at `950` re-confirmed the same `7`-call non-chargeable floor and returned `amountExcludingVatCurrency=17100`
- a later same-day persistent-sandbox re-proof with that same analog employee/project/activity and prompt-like `14` hours at `1150` again finished in `7` calls on fresh date `2026-06-21`, returned `amountExcludingVatCurrency=16100` plus `amountCurrencyOutstanding=16100`, and found no lower-call public replacement path
- for that same sandbox analog with rate `1450` and total hours `39`, `POST /timesheet/entry` with `projectChargeableHours=39` failed with `422 ... Kan ikke være over 24`
- after one successful `24`-hour chunk on `2026-03-26`, a second same-day write for `15` more hours on the same employee + project + activity failed with `409 Det er allerede registrert timer ...`
- the corrected 8-call non-chargeable branch for that `39`-hour analog succeeded with two dates: `GET /employee` -> `GET /project` -> `GET /activity/>forTimeSheet` -> `POST /timesheet/entry` (`24`) -> `POST /timesheet/entry` (`15` on another date) -> `GET /ledger/vatType` -> `POST /order` -> `PUT /order/:invoice`, and the invoice returned `amountExcludingVatCurrency=56550`
- a same-session persistent-sandbox re-proof on 2026-03-20 repeated that exact `39`-hour branch on fresh dates `2026-05-11` / `2026-05-12`, again finished in `8` calls, and did not expose any lower-call public shortcut
- for the same analog project with `Fakturerbart arbeid` and existing exact rate `1550`, the 8-call branch that added `GET /project/hourlyRates` succeeded and the timesheet write returned `chargeable=true`, `hourlyRate=1550`
- on that same chargeable analog, `POST /timesheet/entry` can still succeed with `chargeable=true`, `hourlyRate=0` when the exact employee+activity rate is missing, so skipping `GET /project/hourlyRates` on a chargeable branch is not safe
- after that non-chargeable time write, `POST /order` with one real project-linked manual line and `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?...sendToCustomer=false` still succeeded and produced the expected customer-facing invoice amount
- the 2026-03-20 production German run `Windkraft GmbH` / `882984826` / `Sicherheitsaudit` / `sophia.schmidt@example.org` / `Design` / `18` hours / `950` matched that same non-chargeable branch, finished in `7` calls, and would only have become worse by adding `/project/hourlyRates`
- the 2026-03-20 production Norwegian run `Bergvik AS` / `989231898` / `Plattformintegrasjon` / `ingrid.nilsen@example.org` / `Analyse` / `5` hours / `1400` matched that same non-chargeable branch, returned `amountExcludingVatCurrency=7000` plus `amountCurrencyOutstanding=8750`, and did not expose a lower-call taxable-safe replacement path
- a later 2026-03-20 production German run `Waldstein GmbH` / `948366207` / `Sicherheitsaudit` / `anna.wagner@example.org` / `Analyse` / `14` hours / `1150` matched that same non-chargeable branch, returned `amountExcludingVatCurrency=16100` plus `amountCurrencyOutstanding=20125`, and again showed that adding `/project/hourlyRates` would only waste calls
- `PUT /timesheet/week/:approve` returned `403` even for the token owner; do not make week approval a default step in this task shape
- `GET /project/{id}/period/hourlistReport?...` can show those hours under `nonApprovedHours`
- `GET /project/{id}/period/invoicingReserve?...` can still show a positive fee reserve, but that does not mean the public API can actually charge those hours directly
- `POST /order` with only:
  - `customer`
  - `project`
  - `orderDate`
  - `deliveryDate`
  created a project-linked order and preliminary invoice, but:
  - `GET /invoice/details/{id}?fields=*` still showed `includeHours=false`
  - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?...` failed with `422 Fakturaen inneholder ingen ordrelinjer.`
- `POST /invoice?sendToCustomer=false` with an embedded project order and no real order lines also failed with:
  - `422 Order contains no OrderLines.`
- `POST /order` or `PUT /order/{id}` with nested `preliminaryInvoice.projectInvoiceDetails[].includeHours=true` was accepted/validated, but the resulting preliminary invoice still had:
  - `includeHours=false`
  - `feeAmount=0`
- `PUT /invoice/{id}` and `PUT /invoice/details/{id}` both returned method-not-allowed responses (`405` surfaced as `400 HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed`)
- the only public-API path re-proven to create the invoice side effect was:
  - register the hours separately
  - create a real project-linked order line whose amount is derived from the prompt hours and rate
  - invoice that order normally
- in the same sandbox account, `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=2026-03-20&fields=*` returned only VAT code `6` (`0%`)
- `POST /order` with one embedded project-linked line for `count=5`, `unitPriceExcludingVatCurrency=1750`, `vatType.id=6` then `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?invoiceDate=2026-03-20&sendToCustomer=false` succeeded with:
  - `amountExcludingVatCurrency=8750`
  - `orders[0].id=<orderId>`
  - `projectInvoiceDetails[0].amountOrderLinesAndReinvoicingCurrency=8750`
  - `projectInvoiceDetails[0].includeHours=false`
- the same persistent sandbox already had `1920` / `isInvoiceAccount=true` with `bankAccountNumber=12345678903`, so the proactive `/ledger/account` check added 1 extra call but skipped the PUT
- the 2026-03-21 production French run `Soleil SARL` / `933986861` / `Configuration cloud` / `louis.petit@example.org` / `Design` / `12` hours / `1450` hit the non-chargeable branch and the reactive bank-account recovery cost 10 calls with 1 error; proactive check would have been 9 calls with 0 errors
- persistent-sandbox re-proof on 2026-03-21 confirmed the proactive 8-call branch (with bank account already set) succeeded with 0 errors
- omitting `vatType` from the order line defaults to wrong VAT code `id=0` (0%) instead of the correct outgoing type; GET /ledger/vatType is required on taxable accounts

## Minimal Safe Flow

1. Confirm these operations in `./openapi.json`
   - `GET /employee`
   - `GET /project`
   - `GET /activity/>forTimeSheet`
   - `GET /project/hourlyRates`
   - `PUT /project/hourlyRates/{id}`
   - `POST /project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates`
   - `POST /timesheet/entry`
   - `GET /ledger/vatType`
   - `POST /order`
   - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice`
2. Resolve the employee
   - `GET /employee?email=<email>&count=10&fields=*`
   - exact-match locally because the email filter is containing
3. Resolve the project and linked customer in one read
   - `GET /project?name=<project-name>&count=50&fields=*,customer(*)`
   - exact-match the project name locally
   - exact-match the nested `customer.organizationNumber` and/or `customer.name` locally when the prompt gives them
   - only fall back to a separate `GET /customer` if the project read is ambiguous or unexpectedly sparse
5. Resolve the applicable activity through the project-timesheet endpoint
   - `GET /activity/>forTimeSheet?projectId=<project-id>&employeeId=<employee-id>&date=<date>&query=<activity-name>&filterExistingHours=false&count=50&fields=*`
   - branch on `activity.isChargeable`, not `activity.chargeable`
6. If `activity.isChargeable===true`, continue with the rate path
   - if `activity.isChargeable===false`, skip directly to the timesheet write and keep the exact branch at 7 calls
7. Resolve the project hourly-rate holder
   - `GET /project/hourlyRates?projectId=<project-id>&count=100&fields=*,projectSpecificRates(*,employee(*),activity(*))`
8. If no holder exists yet, create it once
   - `POST /project/hourlyRates`
   - send:
     - `project`
     - `startDate`
     - `hourlyRateModel: "TYPE_PROJECT_SPECIFIC_HOURLY_RATES"`
9. If needed, switch the holder to project-specific rates
   - `PUT /project/hourlyRates/{id}`
   - send:
     - `project`
     - `startDate`
     - `hourlyRateModel: "TYPE_PROJECT_SPECIFIC_HOURLY_RATES"`
10. Reuse or write the exact employee+activity rate
   - if that holder read already exposes one exact employee+activity rate with the prompt hourly rate, reuse it and skip an extra write
   - if it exposes one exact employee+activity rate with a different hourly rate, `PUT /project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates/{id}` once
   - otherwise `POST /project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates`
11. Register the hours
   - `POST /timesheet/entry`
   - send:
     - `employee`
     - `project`
     - `activity`
     - `date`
     - `hours`
     - `projectChargeableHours`
   - keep each entry at `projectChargeableHours <= 24`
   - if the prompt total exceeds `24`, plan one entry per distinct date before the first write
   - if the resolved activity is non-chargeable, still do this write and continue with the invoice fallback when the prompt only scores the requested hours side effect plus the invoice side effect
12. Resolve VAT type and proactively check bank account in parallel
   - `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=<date>&fields=*`
   - `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*`
   - if the invoice account (`1920` / `isInvoiceAccount=true`) has no `bankAccountNumber`, fix it with `PUT /ledger/account/{id}` before the order write
   - if the invoice account already has a `bankAccountNumber`, skip the PUT
   - this proactive check avoids a `422` on `PUT /order/:invoice` plus a 3-call recovery (failed invoice + GET + PUT + retry), saving 1 call and 1 error on fresh accounts
13. Create a real project-linked order line derived from the prompt hours and rate
   - `POST /order`
   - include:
     - `customer`
     - `project`
     - `orderDate`
     - `deliveryDate`
     - one embedded `orderLines[]` row using the prompt hours and prompt rate
14. Invoice that order without sending it
   - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?invoiceDate=<date>&sendToCustomer=false`
15. Only if the proactive check was skipped and that invoice write fails with the company-bank-account validation, repair the invoice bank account and retry the same order once

## Recommended Shapes

Project hourly-rate holder switch:

```json
{
  "project": { "id": 54321 },
  "startDate": "2026-03-20",
  "hourlyRateModel": "TYPE_PROJECT_SPECIFIC_HOURLY_RATES"
}
```

Project-specific rate create:

```json
{
  "projectHourlyRate": { "id": 67890 },
  "employee": { "id": 11111 },
  "activity": { "id": 22222 },
  "hourlyRate": 1750
}
```

Timesheet entry:

```json
{
  "employee": { "id": 11111 },
  "project": { "id": 54321 },
  "activity": { "id": 22222 },
  "date": "2026-03-20",
  "hours": 5,
  "projectChargeableHours": 5
}
```

Fallback public invoice order:

```json
{
  "customer": { "id": 12345 },
  "project": { "id": 54321 },
  "orderDate": "2026-03-20",
  "deliveryDate": "2026-03-20",
  "orderLines": [
    {
      "description": "Design",
      "count": 5,
      "unitPriceExcludingVatCurrency": 1750,
      "vatType": { "id": 6 }
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace VAT id `6` with the filtered outgoing VAT type actually returned for the invoice date.

## Exact-Match Fast Path

- For a prompt that gives:
  - employee email
  - project name plus customer organization number and/or name
  - activity name
  - hour count
  - hourly rate
- the public fast path is usually:
  1. `GET /employee?...`
  2. `GET /project?name=...&fields=*,customer(*)`
  3. `GET /activity/>forTimeSheet?...`
  4. if `activity.isChargeable=false` and prompt hours `<= 24`: `POST /timesheet/entry`
  5. if `activity.isChargeable=false` and prompt hours `> 24`: one `POST /timesheet/entry` per planned date chunk, each `<= 24`
  6. `GET /ledger/vatType?...` and `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*` in parallel
  7. if the invoice account has no `bankAccountNumber`: `PUT /ledger/account/{id}` to fix it
  8. `POST /order`
  9. `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?...sendToCustomer=false`
  10. if `activity.isChargeable=true`: `GET /project/hourlyRates?...fields=*,projectSpecificRates(*,employee(*),activity(*))`
  11. if `activity.isChargeable=true` and no holder exists yet: `POST /project/hourlyRates`
  12. if needed: conditional `PUT /project/hourlyRates/{id}`
  13. if `activity.isChargeable=true` and the exact rate is missing: `POST /project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates`
  14. if `activity.isChargeable=true` and the exact rate exists but differs: `PUT /project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates/{id}`
  15. if `activity.isChargeable=true` and prompt hours `<= 24`: `POST /timesheet/entry`
  16. if `activity.isChargeable=true` and prompt hours `> 24`: one `POST /timesheet/entry` per planned date chunk, each `<= 24`
  17. steps 6-9 apply to both chargeable and non-chargeable branches
- do not insert a default week-approval write
- do not spend speculative attempts to make a project preliminary invoice include hours
- do not stop the run just because the resolved activity is non-chargeable when the prompt only asks for the hours side effect plus the customer-facing invoice side effect

## Verification Shape

- `POST /project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates`
  - expect `ResponseWrapperProjectSpecificRate`
  - verify:
    - `employee.id`
    - `activity.id`
    - `hourlyRate`
- `POST /timesheet/entry`
  - expect `ResponseWrapperTimesheetEntry`
  - verify:
    - `hours`
    - `projectChargeableHours`
    - `project.id`
    - `activity.id`
  - on the chargeable branch, also verify:
    - `hourlyRate`
    - `chargeable`
  - on the non-chargeable fallback branch, expect:
    - `chargeable=false`
    - `hourlyRate=0`
- `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice`
  - expect `ResponseWrapperInvoice`
  - verify:
    - `customer.id`
    - `amountExcludingVatCurrency`
    - `amountCurrencyOutstanding`
- optional `GET /invoice/{id}?fields=*,orders(*,project(*),orderLines(*)),orderLines(*)`
  - use only if the invoice write response is too sparse for the scored fields

## Avoidable Mistakes

- Do not assume `PUT /timesheet/week/:approve` is required or even permitted for this task shape
- Do not branch on `activity.chargeable`; the field from `/activity/>forTimeSheet` is `isChargeable`, and the wrong key can silently skip the rate path on billable activities
- Do not try to attach a project-specific rate to a non-chargeable activity; the server returns `422 activity.id: Ikke fakturerbar.`
- Do not ignore already-expanded `projectSpecificRates` and then blindly `POST /project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates`; that can waste a write or trigger a duplicate-rate validation branch in persistent/repeat contexts
- Do not assume a successful `POST /timesheet/entry` on a chargeable activity proves the prompt rate was applied; without the exact employee+activity rate it can still return `chargeable=true` and `hourlyRate=0`
- Do not add `GET /project/hourlyRates` on the non-chargeable branch just because the prompt names an hourly rate; the exact `Windkraft GmbH` / `Sicherheitsaudit` / `Design` production run re-confirmed that this would have been a wasted call once `/activity/>forTimeSheet` already returned `isChargeable=false`
- Do not generalize the `0%`-only sandbox shortcut of omitting `orderLines[].vatType`; taxable accounts can still silently create a wrong no-VAT invoice, so the default scored path keeps `GET /ledger/vatType`
- Do not send `projectChargeableHours > 24` in one entry; Tripletex rejects it with `422`
- Do not try to finish a `>24`-hour total by stacking two same-day entries for the same employee + project + activity; the second write returns `409`
- Do not assume `projectChargeableHours` overrides a non-chargeable activity; the timesheet entry can still come back with `chargeable=false` and `hourlyRate=0`
- Do not stop the run solely because of that non-chargeable timesheet response when the prompt only scores requested hours registration plus the invoice side effect; the scoring-first fallback is still the timesheet write plus a manual project-linked order/invoice
- Do not assume a positive project invoicing reserve means the public API can actually charge those hours into an invoice
- Do not use `POST /order` or `POST /invoice` with a project but no real order lines as the invoicing write; both public paths were re-proven to fail for this task shape
- Do not treat writable-looking nested `preliminaryInvoice.projectInvoiceDetails[].includeHours=true` as a working path; the server accepts or validates the payload but still persists `includeHours=false`
- Do not rely on `PUT /invoice/{id}` or `PUT /invoice/details/{id}`; both were re-proven as method-not-allowed
- Do not assume the fallback public invoice consumes the registered project-hour reserve; it creates the customer-facing invoice side effect but leaves `includeHours=false`
- Do not skip the proactive `GET /ledger/account` check in this task shape; the 2026-03-21 production run proved that the reactive recovery (failed invoice + GET + PUT + retry) costs 3 extra calls and 1 error vs the proactive check which costs 1 extra call and 0 errors
- Run `GET /ledger/vatType` and `GET /ledger/account` in parallel to minimize wall time without increasing call count
