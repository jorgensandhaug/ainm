# Create Employee

## Scope

Use for tasks like:
- create one new employee
- prompt provides identity fields such as name, birth date, email, and start date
- no salary, leave, login-role assignment, or update/delete flow is requested

## Verified Findings

Sandbox verification showed:
- `POST /employee` fails with `422` if `userType` is omitted
- `POST /employee` fails with `422` if `department.id` is omitted in accounts where department is required
- `POST /employee` accepts nested `employments: [{ "startDate": "YYYY-MM-DD" }]`
- the employee create response may still omit `userType` and nested employment fields even when creation succeeded
- `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=...&fields=*` confirmed the requested start date after create

Persistent-sandbox re-verification on 2026-03-19 showed:
- `POST /employee` succeeded with `userType: "NO_ACCESS"`, `department: { "id": ... }`, and nested `employments`
- the `201` response echoed `userType: null` even though `NO_ACCESS` was sent
- the `201` response included `employments: [{ "id": ..., "url": ... }]` but still did not echo `startDate`
- `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=...&fields=*` returned the authoritative `startDate`

Persistent-sandbox re-verification on 2026-03-20 showed:
- some accounts also reject nested employments without `division.id`
- one decisive `GET /division?count=1&fields=*` provided a usable division for the same create payload

Observed validation messages:
- missing `userType`: `Brukertype kan ikke være "0" eller tom.`
- missing `department.id`: `Feltet må fylles ut.`
- missing `employments.division.id`: `Arbeidsforholdet må knyttes til en virksomhet/underenhet.`

## Minimal Safe Flow

1. Confirm `POST /employee`, `GET /department`, optional `POST /department`, optional `GET /division`, and `GET /employee/employment` in `./openapi.json`
2. Resolve department before employee creation
   - `GET /department?isInactive=false&count=1&fields=*`
   - if an active department exists, reuse its `id`
   - if none exists and a department is required, `POST /department` with a minimal name and reuse the returned `id`
3. Build the employee payload with:
   - requested identity fields
   - explicit `userType`
   - `department: { "id": ... }`
   - nested `employments: [{ "startDate": "YYYY-MM-DD" }]` if the prompt includes start date
   - add `division: { "id": ... }` inside each employment row only when account validation requires it
4. `POST /employee`
5. Verify from the write response what it actually returns
6. If the response does not clearly prove the employment start date, do one decisive verification read:
   - `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=<newId>&fields=*`
7. Stop once requested employee fields and start date are confirmed

## Recommended Payload Shape

Use ISO dates. Normalize any localized prompt date first.

```json
{
  "firstName": "Astrid",
  "lastName": "Johansen",
  "dateOfBirth": "1989-06-10",
  "email": "astrid.johansen@example.org",
  "userType": "NO_ACCESS",
  "department": { "id": 12345 },
  "employments": [
    {
      "startDate": "2026-10-25"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Exact-Match Fast Path

- If the prompt only asks to create one employee and gives name, birth date, email, and start date, use this flow:
  1. `GET /department?isInactive=false&count=1&fields=*`
  2. if none exists, `POST /department` with a minimal name-only payload
  3. `POST /employee` with:
     - `firstName`
     - `lastName`
     - `dateOfBirth` in ISO format
     - `email`
     - `userType: "NO_ACCESS"`
     - `department: { "id": ... }`
     - `employments: [{ "startDate": "YYYY-MM-DD" }]`
  4. Inspect `response.value`
  5. If `response.value.employments` does not already include the actual `startDate`, do one decisive `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=<newId>&fields=*`
- Do not add a pre-read on `/employee` for a pure create task
- Do not add any extra employee or department reads beyond the single department lookup and the conditional employment verification read

## Why `NO_ACCESS`

- Use `NO_ACCESS` as the default when the prompt only asks to create the employee and does not ask for login access
- This satisfies the required field without adding unnecessary system access side effects

## Verification Trap

- Do not assume `POST /employee` echoes all writable fields back
- A successful create response may show `email` and `dateOfBirth` but still echo `userType: null`
- A successful create response may include `employments`, but only as references such as `{ "id": ..., "url": ... }` without `startDate`
- If start date is scored, verify it via `/employee/employment` using the returned employee id

## Avoidable Mistakes

- Do not omit `userType`
- Do not assume department is optional just because the schema has no `required` list
- Do not assume `division` is never needed just because older sandbox runs accepted employments without it
- Do not jump straight to `POST /employee/employment` before first trying nested `employments` on create
- Do not spend extra reads on employee lookup for a pure create task
- Do not treat `response.value.userType === null` as proof that the create failed or that `NO_ACCESS` was rejected
- Do not skip the employment verification read just because `response.value.employments` is non-empty
