# Register Travel Expense

## Scope

Use for tasks like:
- register one new travel expense for an existing employee identified by email
- create travel costs such as flight, taxi, ferry, hotel, or similar reimbursement lines
- include per-diem compensation in the same travel expense
- finish in one parent write plus only the verification reads that are actually needed

Do not use for:
- mileage allowance
- accommodation allowance
- attachments
- approval or delivery flows
- project-linked or reinvoiced travel expenses

## Key Findings

Verified in persistent sandbox on 2026-03-20:
- `GET /travelExpense/costCategory?count=1000&fields=*` returned travel categories with `showOnTravelExpenses=true`, including `Fly` and `Taxi`
- `GET /travelExpense/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*` returned one active travel-expense payment type, `Privat utlegg`
- `GET /travelExpense/rate?type=PER_DIEM&isValidDomestic=true&dateFrom=...&dateTo=...&count=1000&fields=*` returned the live per-diem `rateType` options needed for a deliverable overnight trip
- `POST /travelExpense` can create the parent expense, embedded cost rows, and embedded per-diem rows in one write
- `POST /travelExpense` did not need an explicit `department` field when the linked employee already had a department; the created expense inherited that department automatically
- embedded `costs[]` failed with `422` until each row included `amountCurrencyIncVat`
- embedded `perDiemCompensations[]` failed with `422` while `travelDetails.isCompensationFromRates=false`
- changing `travelDetails.isCompensationFromRates` to `true` allowed the same embedded per-diem row to persist with manual `count`, `rate`, and `amount`
- the old create-only branch persisted manual per-diem rows with `rateType=null`, `rateCategory=null`, and `overnightAccommodation=NONE`
- `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` then failed on missing `travelDetails.departureFrom`, missing `perDiemCompensations[].rateType`, and VAT-bearing `costs[].vatType` on a non-VAT-registered sandbox company
- recreating with `travelDetails.departureFrom`, explicit `costs[].vatType={ "id": 0 }`, and per-diem `rateType` plus `overnightAccommodation` allowed `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` to succeed and move the expense to `state=DELIVERED`
- the `POST /travelExpense` response already proved the parent fields and returned child ids/counts, but `costs[]` and `perDiemCompensations[]` came back only as `id`/`url`
- `GET /travelExpense/{id}?fields=*` still kept those child arrays sparse
- `GET /travelExpense/cost?travelExpenseId=...&count=20&fields=*` returned full cost objects with comments, amounts, category ids, and payment-type ids
- `GET /travelExpense/perDiemCompensation?travelExpenseId=...&count=20&fields=*` returned full per-diem objects with `location`, `count`, `rate`, and `amount`
- `PUT /travelExpense/:approve` returned `403` for the sandbox token even with `overrideApprovalFlow=true`; approval is not a trusted default follow-up step
- top-level travel-expense `amount`/`paymentAmount` still reflected only reimbursable cost lines even after successful `:deliver`; those totals are not proof of per-diem correctness

## Lowest-Call Scored Flow

1. Confirm these operations in `./openapi.json`
   - `GET /employee`
   - `GET /travelExpense/costCategory`
   - `GET /travelExpense/paymentType`
   - `GET /travelExpense/rate`
   - `POST /travelExpense`
   - `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver`
2. Locate the employee with one decisive read
   - usually `GET /employee?email=<prompt-email>&count=10&fields=*`
   - filter locally to one exact-email employee
   - prefer `allowInformationRegistration=true` when several exact-email hits exist
3. Resolve one travel payment type, the required cost categories, and a compatible per-diem rate type
   - `GET /travelExpense/costCategory?count=1000&fields=*`
   - `GET /travelExpense/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*`
   - `GET /travelExpense/rate?type=PER_DIEM&isValidDomestic=true&dateFrom=<departureDate>&dateTo=<returnDate>&count=1000&fields=*`
   - filter locally on `showOnTravelExpenses=true`
4. Create the travel expense in one write
   - `POST /travelExpense`
   - embed top-level `travelDetails`
   - embed `perDiemCompensations[]`
   - embed `costs[]`
   - include `travelDetails.departureFrom`
   - include explicit `costs[].vatType`
   - include `perDiemCompensations[].rateType`
   - include `perDiemCompensations[].overnightAccommodation` when the trip spans overnight
   - omit `department` unless the prompt explicitly scores a different department or validation demands it
5. Deliver the expense
   - `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver?id=<travelExpenseId>`
6. Reuse the deliver response and stop
   - `title`
   - `employee.id`
   - `travelDetails.departureDate`
   - `travelDetails.returnDate`
   - `travelDetails.destination`
   - `state=DELIVERED`
   - `costs.length`
   - `perDiemCompensations.length`
7. Stop

## Conditional Investigation Branch

Use the dedicated child reads only when the prompt materially differs from the standard embedded-create shape, a later step truly needs expanded child fields, or the live write/deliver response contradicts the intended child counts.

1. `GET /travelExpense/cost?travelExpenseId=<id>&count=20&fields=*`
2. `GET /travelExpense/perDiemCompensation?travelExpenseId=<id>&count=20&fields=*`
3. Stop

## Winning Payload Shape

For the travel-expense create, the sandbox-proven shape was:

```json
{
  "employee": { "id": 18478235 },
  "title": "Visita cliente Bergen",
  "travelDetails": {
    "isForeignTravel": false,
    "isDayTrip": false,
    "isCompensationFromRates": true,
    "departureDate": "2026-03-19",
    "returnDate": "2026-03-20",
    "departureTime": "08:00",
    "returnTime": "18:00",
    "destination": "Bergen",
    "detailedJourneyDescription": "Visita cliente Bergen",
    "purpose": "Visita cliente Bergen"
  },
  "perDiemCompensations": [
    {
      "location": "Bergen",
      "count": 2,
      "rate": 800,
      "amount": 1600
    }
  ],
  "costs": [
    {
      "costCategory": { "id": 32813722 },
      "paymentType": { "id": 32813706 },
      "comments": "bilhete de avião",
      "amountCurrencyIncVat": 5200,
      "amountNOKInclVAT": 5200,
      "date": "2026-03-19"
    },
    {
      "costCategory": { "id": 32813737 },
      "paymentType": { "id": 32813706 },
      "comments": "táxi",
      "amountCurrencyIncVat": 350,
      "amountNOKInclVAT": 350,
      "date": "2026-03-20"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Validation Traps

- do not omit `amountCurrencyIncVat` on embedded travel costs just because the prompt amount is already in NOK
- do not set `travelDetails.isCompensationFromRates=false` when the same write also includes `perDiemCompensations[]`
- do not waste effort resolving or echoing `department` for a normal existing-employee expense; Tripletex can inherit it from the employee
- do not trust a successful `POST /travelExpense` with manual per-diem `count`/`rate`/`amount` as a fully correct final state; that row can still persist with `rateType=null`
- do not rely on the category default VAT if the expense may need `:deliver`; explicit zero-VAT cost rows were required in sandbox for a non-VAT-registered company
- do not assume approval is available after delivery; sandbox `PUT /travelExpense/:approve` returned `403`
- do not assume `GET /travelExpense/{id}?fields=*` expands child rows; it can stay link-only for both costs and per-diems

## Category And Payment-Type Resolution

- `GET /travelExpense/costCategory` does not expose a query parameter equivalent to `showOnTravelExpenses=true`, so fetch the set once and filter locally
- prefer exact category-description matches before fallback heuristics:
  - `Fly` for airfare
  - `Taxi` for taxi
- for the payment type, prefer one active travel-expense reimbursement type from the lookup; persistent sandbox exposed `Privat utlegg`

## Per-Diem Resolution

- for multi-day domestic per-diem tasks, resolve one compatible live `rateType` from `GET /travelExpense/rate?...fields=*`; do not leave `perDiemCompensations[].rateType` empty
- preserve the prompt's scored `count`, `rate`, and `amount`, but still include a compatible `rateType` so the row is deliverable
- if the trip spans overnight, set `overnightAccommodation`; sandbox accepted the generic branch `HOTEL`
- if the prompt omits `departureFrom` or gives too little information to choose an overnight-accommodation branch safely, the old 4-call OPEN create is not a trusted full-correctness path for that prompt shape

## Date Inference For Underspecified Prompts

- if the prompt gives a trip duration but no explicit dates, do not burn API calls trying to derive dates from Tripletex
- use one deterministic fallback range instead; the default is an inclusive range ending on the run date
- for a `4` day trip on run date `2026-03-20`, the fallback range is `departureDate=2026-03-17` and `returnDate=2026-03-20`
- keep cost dates internally consistent with that inferred range, for example departure-leg transport on `departureDate` and return-leg taxi on `returnDate`

## Verification Shape

- `POST /travelExpense` verified the parent expense and returned:
  - the parent `id`
  - the linked `employee.id`
  - the requested `travelDetails`
  - `costs[].id/url` plus count
  - `perDiemCompensations[].id/url` plus count
- `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` verified the corrected final parent state and returned `state=DELIVERED`
- the parent `amount`/`paymentAmount` remained cost-only in sandbox, so they are not decisive proof of per-diem correctness
- `GET /travelExpense/cost?...` and `GET /travelExpense/perDiemCompensation?...` remain the decisive investigation branch when expanded child verification is genuinely needed

## When Not To Add Extra Reads

- do not add a pre-read of `/travelExpense` for a pure create task
- do not add `GET /travelExpense/cost` or `GET /travelExpense/perDiemCompensation` in the standard scored flow just to double-check child persistence
- do not add `GET /travelExpense/{id}`; it still leaves child arrays sparse and is not part of either the canonical scoring path or the conditional investigation branch
- do not split the create into separate `POST /travelExpense/cost` and `POST /travelExpense/perDiemCompensation` calls unless the prompt materially differs from the embedded-create shape
