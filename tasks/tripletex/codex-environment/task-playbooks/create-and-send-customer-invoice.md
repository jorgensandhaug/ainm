# Create and Send Customer Invoice

## Scope

Use for tasks like:
- create an invoice for an existing or new customer
- send the invoice after creation
- invoice has one or more simple order lines

## Key Finding: Company Bank Account Registration

If `POST /invoice` fails with:

`Faktura kan ikke opprettes før selskapet har registrert et bankkontonummer.`

then the practical fix is:

1. Find the company bank ledger account with:
   `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*`
2. Pick the existing invoice account:
   usually account `1920`
   must have `isInvoiceAccount=true`
3. Register the bank account number on that account:

```http
PUT /ledger/account/{id}
{
  "bankAccountNumber": "12345678903"
}
```

This was verified in sandbox:
- invoice creation failed before this update
- invoice creation succeeded after this update

## Key Finding: Resolve VAT Type Dynamically

Do not hardcode invoice line `vatType.id = 3`.

Use:

`GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=<invoice-date>&fields=*`

and choose from the filtered result for the actual invoice date.

This was re-verified in sandbox on 2026-03-19:
- `POST /invoice` failed with `Ugyldig mva-kode.` when line VAT was hardcoded to `3`
- `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=2026-03-19&fields=*` returned only VAT code `6`
- invoice creation succeeded after using the dynamically resolved VAT type from that filtered result

## Important Constraints

- Do not assume there is a separate public company-level bank-account endpoint in `openapi.json`
- The public/spec-confirmed path that solved this was `PUT /ledger/account/{id}`
- Do not create a second invoice bank account with the same `bankAccountNumber`
- Duplicate bank account numbers trigger validation errors
- Prefer updating existing `1920` over creating a new invoice account
- Do not hardcode invoice/order-line VAT code `3`
- The authoritative candidate set for invoice lines is the filtered `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=...&fields=*` result on the invoice date

## Minimal Flow

1. Find or create the customer
   - usually `GET /customer?organizationNumber=...&fields=*`
2. Ensure invoice delivery method is usable
   - if needed, update customer send method before sending
3. Ensure company invoice bank account is registered
   - `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*`
   - update existing invoice account with `PUT /ledger/account/{id}`
4. Resolve a valid outgoing VAT type for the invoice date
   - `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=<invoice-date>&fields=*`
   - use a VAT type that actually exists in that filtered response
5. Create invoice with `sendToCustomer=false`
   - include required dates
   - include `orders`
   - include `orderLines` inside the order, not directly on invoice input
6. Send invoice explicitly with:
   - `PUT /invoice/{id}/:send?sendType=...`

## Invoice Payload Notes

- `invoiceDueDate` is required
- `orders[].deliveryDate` is required
- `invoice.orderLines` is read-only in the schema
- create lines under `orders[].orderLines`

Example shape:

```json
{
  "invoiceDate": "2026-03-19",
  "invoiceDueDate": "2026-04-02",
  "customer": { "id": 123 },
  "orders": [
    {
      "customer": { "id": 123 },
      "orderDate": "2026-03-19",
      "deliveryDate": "2026-03-19",
      "orderLines": [
        {
          "description": "Analyserapport",
          "count": 1,
          "unitPriceExcludingVatCurrency": 7850,
          "vatType": { "id": 6 }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In real tasks, replace `6` with the VAT type resolved from the filtered `GET /ledger/vatType` response for the invoice date. Do not assume the same code is valid across accounts.

## If You Still Need to Probe

- First test in sandbox if available
- Reproduce with one simple zero-VAT or standard-VAT line
- If invoice fails after bank-account registration, use the new validation message as the next branch
- Reuse returned IDs from write responses
