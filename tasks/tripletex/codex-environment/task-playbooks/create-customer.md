# Create Customer

## Scope

Use for tasks like:
- create one customer
- prompt provides customer identity fields directly
- no invoice, order, payment, or update/delete flow is requested

## Key Finding: Simple Customer Creation Is A One-Call POST

For a standard Norwegian customer create task, the efficient default is:

`POST /customer`

with only the requested fields, typically:

```json
{
  "name": "Reflection Smoke Test AS",
  "email": "post@reflection-smoke.no",
  "organizationNumber": "999888777"
}
```

This was verified in sandbox:
- direct `POST /customer` succeeded
- no pre-read was needed
- the write response already proved the final scored fields
- Tripletex filled defaults like `invoiceSendMethod=EMAIL` and `emailAttachmentType=ATTACHMENT`
- the response came back as `{"value": {...}}` with the created customer id and requested fields
- when the prompt gave a single street address, `postalAddress` alone was sufficient; no `physicalAddress` was needed
- re-verified on 2026-03-19 with only `name`, `email`, and `organizationNumber`; the `201` response again contained the created customer plus default invoice delivery fields
- re-verified on 2026-03-19 in persistent sandbox with `name`, `organizationNumber`, `email`, and `postalAddress`; the `201` response preserved non-ASCII text such as `Grünfeld` and `Ålesund` and still defaulted `invoiceSendMethod=EMAIL` and `emailAttachmentType=ATTACHMENT` without needing `invoiceEmail`
- re-verified on 2026-03-19 with `name`, `email`, `organizationNumber`, and `postalAddress`; the same single `POST /customer` stored the exact Unicode city string `Tromsø` and returned it directly in `response.value.postalAddress.city`

## Minimal Flow

1. Confirm `POST /customer` and the `Customer` schema in `./openapi.json`
2. Build the smallest payload that matches the prompt
3. `POST /customer`
4. Verify the requested fields from the `201` response body
5. Stop

## Exact-Match Fast Path

- If the prompt only asks to create one customer and gives `name`, `email`, and `organizationNumber`, send exactly those fields
- Confirm only the exact `POST /customer` operation and its referenced request/response schemas
- Do not enumerate other customer-related schemas or add a pre-read just because sandbox is persistent
- If the prompt also gives one ordinary mailing address, add only `postalAddress`
- Do not transliterate prompt text; preserve Unicode in customer and city names exactly as given
- The winning shape is typically:

```json
{
  "name": "Same Agent Prompt Test AS",
  "email": "post@same-agent-prompt.no",
  "organizationNumber": "999888777"
}
```

- Verify directly from `response.value` and stop

## OpenAPI Navigation Trap

- `openapi.json` contains multiple customer-related schemas
- Do not get misled by later read-only customer/account representations
- For create-customer tasks, use the schema referenced by `POST /customer`: `#/components/schemas/Customer`
- The minimal create payload still works even though other customer-shaped schemas expose many extra or read-only fields

## Verification Shape

- Expect `201 Created`
- Expect a wrapper of shape `{"value": {...}}`
- Verify the requested scored fields directly from `value`
- Reuse the returned `id` if any follow-up step unexpectedly depends on it

## Address Mapping For Standard Customer Creates

- If the prompt gives one ordinary postal/street address, map it to `postalAddress`
- Preserve address strings exactly as given in the prompt, including non-ASCII characters like `ø`
- Use:

```json
{
  "postalAddress": {
    "addressLine1": "Sjøgata 51",
    "postalCode": "9008",
    "city": "Tromsø"
  }
}
```

- Do not guess `physicalAddress` as well unless the prompt explicitly distinguishes a separate visiting/physical address
- The `201` response can already prove the stored address fields, so no follow-up `GET` is needed

## Email Mapping For Standard Customer Creates

- If the prompt gives one generic email address such as `E-mail`, `Email`, or `E‑post`, map it to `email`
- Do not also mirror that same address into `invoiceEmail` unless the prompt explicitly says it is the invoice/billing email
- A single prompt email does not, by itself, justify inventing a separate invoice-delivery email field
- The standard create flow still defaults invoice delivery fields from the account/customer setup, so adding `invoiceEmail` speculatively is unnecessary

## When Not To Pre-Read

- Do not `GET /customer` first just to check whether the customer already exists
- Do not add sandbox-style idempotency logic to a scored create task
- Do not fetch the created customer again if the write response already contains the needed fields

## When A Read Is Actually Needed

- update existing customer
- delete or reverse existing customer-related objects
- prompt refers to an already-existing customer
- prompt is ambiguous and you must locate the target entity before writing

## Extra Fields Only When The Prompt Implies Them

- If EHF or another invoice send mode is requested or implied, include the required delivery/address data
- If the prompt gives one normal customer address and does not distinguish address types, send only `postalAddress`
- If the organization is foreign, set country/address fields consistently
- Otherwise, avoid speculative address or invoice configuration fields
