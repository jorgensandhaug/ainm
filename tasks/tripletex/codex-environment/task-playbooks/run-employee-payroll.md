# Run Employee Payroll

## Scope

Use for tasks like:
- run payroll for one existing employee for a specific month
- the prompt gives the employee identity, usually email and/or name
- the prompt gives one or more salary amounts such as base salary, bonus, or other manual pay lines
- the task is to create the payroll transaction, not to create the employee from scratch

Do not use for:
- employee-creation tasks
- payment-registration tasks after invoice creation
- travel-expense reimbursement flows

## Verified Findings

Production failure analysis on 2026-03-20 showed:
- for the exact prompt targeting `joao.santos@example.org`, one decisive `GET /employee?email=...&count=10&fields=*` returned the exact employee match with `dateOfBirth=null`
- that single read was sufficient to treat the run as blocked
- therefore the original run should not have continued into `GET /salary/type`, `POST /salary/transaction`, or any guessed employee-repair flow
- if the prompt does not provide missing personal or payroll-setup data, do not invent `dateOfBirth`, employment setup, or division/business linkage

Persistent-sandbox verification on 2026-03-20 proved the successful path:
- `POST /salary/transaction` succeeded with embedded manual payslip specifications for `Fastlønn` and `Bonus`
- `GET /employee?fields=*` can still return `employments[]` as sparse stubs with null `startDate`, null `division`, and empty-looking `employmentDetails[]`
- one conditional `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=...&fields=*` expanded the decisive payroll facts for the proof employee:
  - `startDate=2026-03-01`
  - active employment in the payroll period
  - `division.id=108244568`
  - returned payroll-setup links through `employmentDetails[]` / `latestSalary`
- the salary write failed with `422 department: Selskapet har ikke aktivert avdelingsregnskap.` when `department` was included in the salary payload in an account without department accounting
- after omitting `department` from the salary payload, the flow succeeded
- one immediate `GET /salary/transaction/{id}?fields=*` returned the created payslip id
- one immediate `GET /salary/payslip/{id}?fields=*` then verified:
  - `grossAmount=46200`
  - `amount=46200`
  - `specifications.length=2`
- for exact line-level verification, `GET /salary/payslip/{id}?fields=*,specifications(*,salaryType(*))` expanded the individual manual salary lines; plain `fields=*` kept `specifications[]` as link-only objects

## Minimal Safe Flow

1. Confirm these operations in `./openapi.json`
   - `GET /employee`
   - optional conditional prerequisite expansion:
     - `GET /employee/employment`
   - `GET /salary/type`
   - `POST /salary/transaction`
   - optional verification:
     - `GET /salary/transaction/{id}`
     - `GET /salary/payslip/{id}`
2. Resolve the employee with one decisive read
   - usually `GET /employee?email=<email>&count=10&fields=*`
   - exact-match the email locally because the API filter is containing, not exact
3. Check payroll prerequisites from that same employee object before any salary write
   - `dateOfBirth` must be present
   - if the employee object already expands the employment dates and payroll setup enough to judge the requested payroll period, reuse that data directly
4. Only if the embedded employee employments are too sparse to judge the payroll period, do one conditional employment read
   - `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=<employeeId>&count=20&fields=*`
   - confirm at least one employment that covers the requested payroll period
   - confirm the employment is tied to a real `division`
   - do not widen into `GET /employee/employment/details` just because `employmentDetails[]` or `latestSalary` stay partly sparse
5. If those prerequisites are missing and the prompt does not provide the missing personal/payroll-setup facts needed to repair them, stop and treat the run as blocked
   - do not invent `dateOfBirth`
   - do not invent business/sub-entity registration data
6. Resolve salary types with one read
   - `GET /salary/type?count=1000&fields=*`
   - exact-match the needed type names locally, typically `Fastlønn` and `Bonus`
7. Create the payroll transaction
   - `POST /salary/transaction`
   - include:
     - `date`
     - `year`
     - `month`
     - `paySlipsAvailableDate`
     - one `payslips[]` entry for the target employee
     - embedded manual `specifications[]` entries for the requested salary lines
8. Reuse the write response first
   - keep the returned transaction id
9. If the write response is too sparse for proof, do one immediate verification branch
   - `GET /salary/transaction/{id}?fields=*`
   - take the returned payslip id
   - `GET /salary/payslip/{payslipId}?fields=*` for gross/net amount and specification count
   - `GET /salary/payslip/{payslipId}?fields=*,specifications(*,salaryType(*))` only when the task scores the exact manual salary lines themselves

## Recommended Payload Shape

Resolve the salary type ids first, then send:

```json
{
  "date": "2026-03-20",
  "year": 2026,
  "month": 3,
  "paySlipsAvailableDate": "2026-03-20",
  "payslips": [
    {
      "employee": { "id": 12345 },
      "date": "2026-03-20",
      "year": 2026,
      "month": 3,
      "specifications": [
        {
          "employee": { "id": 12345 },
          "salaryType": { "id": 69031179 },
          "description": "Fastlønn mars 2026",
          "year": 2026,
          "month": 3,
          "count": 1,
          "rate": 42350,
          "amount": 42350
        },
        {
          "employee": { "id": 12345 },
          "salaryType": { "id": 69031348 },
          "description": "Bonus mars 2026",
          "year": 2026,
          "month": 3,
          "count": 1,
          "rate": 12850,
          "amount": 12850
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace the ids and amounts with the task-specific values.

## Exact-Match Fast Path

- For a prompt that:
  - identifies one existing employee by email
  - asks to run payroll for one month
  - gives a base salary and one bonus amount
- the winning flow is usually:
  1. `GET /employee?email=...&count=10&fields=*`
  2. if that employee read keeps the employments too sparse to judge the payroll period, `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=...&count=20&fields=*`
  3. `GET /salary/type?count=1000&fields=*`
  4. `POST /salary/transaction`
- if the first employee read already shows missing `dateOfBirth`, the winning path is to stop after that single call
- only add the verification branch if the write response does not already prove the created payroll transaction strongly enough
- only branch into payroll-prerequisite repair if the prompt actually supplies the missing repair data

## Payroll Prerequisite Trap

- Do not assume every existing employee is payroll-ready
- Before the salary write, the employee must already have the payroll prerequisites needed by the account configuration
- Do not assume `GET /employee?fields=*` always expands employment dates and division data enough to judge readiness
- Missing prerequisites can surface as employee-level validation errors on `POST /salary/transaction`, such as:
  - missing employment in the period
  - missing `dateOfBirth` when trying to create the needed employment
  - missing business linkage for the employment
- If the prompt does not provide the missing personal or business-registration data, do not guess them

## Department Trap

- Do not automatically copy the employee's department into the salary payload
- In accounts without department accounting, `POST /salary/transaction` fails with:
  - `department: Selskapet har ikke aktivert avdelingsregnskap.`
- Only include `department` on payslips/specifications when the account configuration clearly supports it or the prompt explicitly requires it

## Verification Shape

- `POST /salary/transaction`
  - expect `ResponseWrapperSalaryTransaction`
  - keep the returned transaction id
- `GET /salary/transaction/{id}?fields=*`
  - expect the created `payslips[]` ids
- `GET /salary/payslip/{id}?fields=*`
  - can verify:
    - `grossAmount`
    - `amount`
    - `specifications.length`
- `GET /salary/payslip/{id}?fields=*,specifications(*,salaryType(*))`
  - can verify:
    - exact manual-line `amount`
    - exact manual-line `salaryType.name`
    - exact manual-line `description`

## Avoidable Mistakes

- Do not jump straight to `POST /salary/transaction` without first checking whether the target employee is payroll-ready
- Do not invent `dateOfBirth` for an existing employee when the prompt never supplied it
- Do not treat sparse `employee.employments[]` on `GET /employee?fields=*` as proof that no employment exists; do one conditional `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=...&fields=*` first
- Do not guess a business/sub-entity setup just because payroll validation mentions `virksomhet`
- Do not include `department` blindly in the salary payload
- Do not widen into generic salary browsing when `GET /employee` already proves the task is blocked on missing prerequisites
- Do not rely on `GET /salary/payslip/{id}?fields=*` alone when the task scores the exact manual salary-line contents
