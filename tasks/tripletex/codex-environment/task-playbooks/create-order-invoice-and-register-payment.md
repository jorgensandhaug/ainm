# Create Order, Invoice, and Register Full Payment

## Scope

Use for tasks like:
- create an order for an existing customer
- use one or more existing products on the order
- convert that order into an invoice
- register full payment on the created invoice
- do not send the invoice unless the prompt explicitly asks for sending

Do not use for:
- create-only order tasks with no invoice/payment step
- invoice-send tasks where customer delivery/send method is the main concern
- update/delete/reverse flows on existing orders or invoices

## Key Findings

- `POST /order` can create embedded `orderLines`, but the `201` response may still echo `orderLines=[]`
- do not treat an empty `response.value.orderLines` on `POST /order` as proof that line creation failed
- sandbox verification on 2026-03-20 showed:
  - `POST /order` with embedded `orderLines` returned `orderLines=[]` in `response.value`
  - `GET /order/{id}?fields=*,customer(*),orderLines(*)` on that same order returned the expected 2 order lines
  - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?invoiceDate=2026-03-20&sendToCustomer=false` on an order created that way succeeded directly
  - the invoice response returned `amountExcludingVatCurrency=20450` and `amountCurrencyOutstanding=20450`
  - `PUT /invoice/{id}/:payment?...` reduced the remaining outstanding amount to `0`
- product lookup verification on 2026-03-20 showed:
  - `GET /product?productNumber=<a>&productNumber=<b>&fields=*` returned both target products
  - `GET /product?ids=<id-a>,<id-b>&fields=*` also returned both target products
  - therefore, for numeric product refs in the prompt, product-number lookup is a good first try and one fallback ID lookup is enough if needed

## Minimal Flow

1. Confirm these operations in `./openapi.json`
   - `GET /customer`
   - `GET /product`
   - `GET /ledger/account`
   - `POST /order`
   - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice`
   - `GET /invoice/paymentType`
   - `PUT /invoice/{id}/:payment`
2. Resolve the customer
   - usually `GET /customer?organizationNumber=...&fields=*`
3. Resolve the products from prompt refs
   - first try `GET /product?productNumber=<ref>&productNumber=<ref>&fields=*`
   - if that does not uniquely resolve the products, do one fallback `GET /product?ids=<ref>,<ref>&fields=*`
4. Ensure the company invoice bank account is registered if needed
   - `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*`
   - if the invoice account bank number is missing, update that existing invoice account with `PUT /ledger/account/{id}`
5. Create the order with embedded lines
   - `POST /order`
   - send `customer`, `orderDate`, `deliveryDate`
   - embed `orderLines` with `product: { id }`, `description`, `count`, and the requested unit price
6. Convert the order into an invoice without sending it
   - `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?invoiceDate=<date>&sendToCustomer=false`
7. Reuse the invoice write response
   - use `amountCurrencyOutstanding` first, otherwise `amountOutstanding`
   - use invoice totals/lines in that response as verification where available
8. Resolve one usable incoming payment type
   - `GET /invoice/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*,debitAccount(*),creditAccount(*)`
   - prefer a normal incoming payment type, typically debit account `19xx` and customer ledger credit `15xx`
9. Register full payment
   - `PUT /invoice/{id}/:payment?paymentDate=<date>&paymentTypeId=<id>&paidAmount=<outstanding>`
10. Verify from the payment write response
   - stop when remaining outstanding amount is `0`

## Exact-Match Fast Path

- For a prompt that already identifies:
  - the existing customer by organization number
  - the existing products by numeric refs
  - the order line prices
  - the need to invoice and fully pay immediately
- the winning path is usually:
  1. `GET /customer?organizationNumber=...&fields=*`
  2. `GET /product?productNumber=<ref>&productNumber=<ref>&fields=*`
  3. if needed, `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*`
  4. `POST /order` with embedded `orderLines`
  5. `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?invoiceDate=<date>&sendToCustomer=false`
  6. `GET /invoice/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*,debitAccount(*),creditAccount(*)`
  7. `PUT /invoice/{id}/:payment?...`
- Do not insert an automatic `GET /order/{id}` just because `POST /order` echoed empty `orderLines`
- If the invoice response already proves the charged lines/totals and outstanding amount, that later write response is often enough

## Order Payload Notes

- Use the `Order` schema referenced by `POST /order`
- a safe embedded-line shape is:

```json
{
  "customer": { "id": 123 },
  "orderDate": "2026-03-20",
  "deliveryDate": "2026-03-20",
  "orderLines": [
    {
      "product": { "id": 456 },
      "description": "Training session",
      "count": 1,
      "unitPriceExcludingVatCurrency": 5700
    },
    {
      "product": { "id": 789 },
      "description": "Consulting hours",
      "count": 1,
      "unitPriceExcludingVatCurrency": 14750
    }
  ]
}
```

- if the account/product setup requires it, include a valid `vatType` on the order line
- when you already resolved products from `GET /product?fields=*`, reuse the returned product IDs directly

## Response Shape Trap

- `POST /order` may not be a reliable verifier for embedded line creation
- specifically, the write response can contain:

```json
{
  "value": {
    "id": 401954042,
    "orderLines": []
  }
}
```

- even though the order actually contains lines and can be invoiced immediately
- do not branch into a corrective rewrite just because that field is empty
- only add `GET /order/{id}?fields=*,orderLines(*)` if you truly need decisive pre-invoice verification

## Product Resolution Rules

- When the prompt names existing products with numeric refs in parentheses, try product-number resolution first
- Use:
  - `GET /product?productNumber=<ref>&productNumber=<ref>&fields=*`
- If that does not uniquely resolve the products, do one fallback:
  - `GET /product?ids=<ref>,<ref>&fields=*`
- Do not spray multiple exploratory `/product` reads after that
- Reuse the resolved product objects for IDs and any needed VAT context

## Payment Rules

- Do not derive the payment amount from the prompt’s ex-VAT sum
- Use the outstanding amount from the just-created invoice response:
  - `amountCurrencyOutstanding` first
  - otherwise `amountOutstanding`
- This avoids VAT and currency mistakes

## Verification Shape

- `POST /order`:
  - trust the returned `id`
  - do not over-trust `orderLines`
- `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice`:
  - expect `ResponseWrapperInvoice`
  - reuse `id`, `invoiceNumber`, invoice totals, and outstanding amount
- `PUT /invoice/{id}/:payment`:
  - expect `ResponseWrapperInvoice`
  - verify remaining outstanding amount is `0`

## If You Still Need To Probe

- First probe only the exact missing uncertainty
- Good examples:
  - `GET /order/{id}?fields=*,orderLines(*)` if you must confirm line creation before invoicing
  - `GET /product?ids=...&fields=*` if product-number lookup failed
- Avoid widening into generic invoice/order browsing when the created invoice or payment response already proves the next step
