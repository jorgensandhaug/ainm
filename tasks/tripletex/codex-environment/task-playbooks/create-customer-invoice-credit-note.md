# Create Customer Invoice Credit Note

## Scope

Use for tasks like:
- issue a full credit note for one existing outgoing customer invoice
- locate the original invoice from prompt facts such as customer organization number, ex-VAT amount, and invoice-line/service description
- reverse the full invoice without manually touching vouchers or payments

Do not use for:
- partial credit notes
- payment reversals
- creating the original invoice first
- tasks that explicitly require sending the credit note unless you have already confirmed the correct send behavior

## Key Findings

- the correct full-credit endpoint is `PUT /invoice/{id}/:createCreditNote`
- required query parameter:
  - `date`
- optional but important query parameter:
  - `sendToCustomer`
- `GET /invoice` requires both `invoiceDateFrom` and `invoiceDateTo`
- a single decisive invoice read can often replace a separate `GET /customer` if the prompt already gives enough identifying facts
- the credit-note write returns `ResponseWrapperInvoice`, and in sandbox it returned the created credit note itself, not just the updated original invoice
- for prompts without an exact invoice id, two API calls are the minimal realistic path
- a one-call path exists only when the prompt already gives the exact invoice id

Verified on 2026-03-20:
- original production run succeeded in two API calls:
  - `GET /invoice?invoiceDateFrom=2000-01-01&invoiceDateTo=2026-03-21&count=1000&sorting=-invoiceDate&fields=*,customer(*),orderLines(*),orders(*,orderLines(*))`
  - `PUT /invoice/{id}/:createCreditNote?date=2026-03-20&sendToCustomer=false`
- the exact successful production prompt shape was:
  - `customer.organizationNumber=900993560`
  - `amountExcludingVatCurrency=30500`
  - `description="Maintenance"`
- that production run was already minimal-call for this prompt shape:
  - no `GET /customer`
  - no `GET /invoice/{id}`
  - no voucher lookup or reversal
- a second production run on 2026-03-20 again succeeded in the same two API calls for:
  - `customer.organizationNumber=812449982`
  - `amountExcludingVatCurrency=45300`
  - `description="Datarådgjeving"`
- that second production run was also already minimal-call for this prompt shape:
  - no `GET /customer`
  - no `GET /invoice/{id}`
  - no extra `openapi.json` confirmation was needed once the trusted standard already matched
- persistent-sandbox re-verification created a fixture invoice and then proved that:
  - one `GET /invoice?invoiceDateFrom=2026-01-01&invoiceDateTo=2027-01-01&count=1000&sorting=-invoiceDate&fields=*,customer(*),orderLines(*),orders(*,orderLines(*))` was enough to locate the unique target invoice by:
    - `customer.organizationNumber`
    - `amountExcludingVat` or `amountExcludingVatCurrency`
    - exact `orderLines[].description` / `orders[].orderLines[].description`
    - `isCreditNote != true`
    - `isCredited != true`
  - the same exact line description can appear in both `orderLines[]` and `orders[].orderLines[]` on that one invoice; keep uniqueness at the invoice id level instead of treating duplicate line hits as ambiguity
  - `PUT /invoice/{id}/:createCreditNote?date=2026-03-20&sendToCustomer=false` returned a new invoice object with:
    - `isCreditNote=true`
    - `creditedInvoice=<original invoice id>`
    - its own credit-note `id`
    - its own credit-note `invoiceNumber`
  - a disposable sandbox fixture matching the current production-style facts `description="Datarådgjeving"` and `amountExcludingVatCurrency=45300` again proved the same two-call core after setup
  - on that disposable `Datarådgjeving` fixture, the locate read showed two identical description hits across top-level and nested line arrays on the same invoice; dedupe at the invoice id and keep the flow at two API calls
  - a disposable sandbox fixture matching the exact production identifiers `organizationNumber=900993560`, `description="Maintenance"`, `amountExcludingVatCurrency=30500` again proved the same two-call core after setup
  - on that exact-identifier fixture, the locate read still showed duplicate `Maintenance` hits across top-level and nested line arrays on the same invoice, and the write response alone still proved success

## Minimal Flow

1. Confirm these operations in `./openapi.json`
   - `GET /invoice`
   - `PUT /invoice/{id}/:createCreditNote`
2. Locate the original invoice with one decisive read
   - usually `GET /invoice?invoiceDateFrom=<wide-from>&invoiceDateTo=<wide-to>&count=1000&sorting=-invoiceDate&fields=*,customer(*),orderLines(*),orders(*,orderLines(*))`
   - if the prompt gives no invoice date, default to one wide but bounded window such as `invoiceDateFrom=2000-01-01` and `invoiceDateTo=<run-date-plus-one-day>`
3. Filter locally to the single correct invoice
   - exact customer organization number if provided
   - exact ex-VAT amount from `amountExcludingVatCurrency` or `amountExcludingVat`
   - exact prompt text match in `orderLines[].description` or `orders[].orderLines[].description`
   - if the same exact description appears in both arrays on one invoice, still count that as one invoice candidate
   - exclude `isCreditNote=true`
   - exclude `isCredited=true`
4. Create the full credit note
   - `PUT /invoice/{id}/:createCreditNote?date=<date>&sendToCustomer=false`
5. Verify from the write response
   - prefer `isCreditNote`
   - verify `creditedInvoice=<original id>`
   - reuse the returned credit-note `id` and `invoiceNumber`
6. Stop

## Exact-Match Fast Path

- For a prompt that:
  - identifies an existing outgoing invoice by customer organization number
  - gives the invoice line/service description
  - gives the ex-VAT amount
  - asks only for a full credit note, not sending or payment reversal
- the winning path is:
  1. `GET /invoice?invoiceDateFrom=<wide-from>&invoiceDateTo=<wide-to>&count=1000&sorting=-invoiceDate&fields=*,customer(*),orderLines(*),orders(*,orderLines(*))`
  2. `PUT /invoice/{id}/:createCreditNote?date=<date>&sendToCustomer=false`
- that two-call path is already minimal for this prompt shape
- for the exact `900993560` + `Maintenance` + `30500` prompt shape, do not try to improve it with a separate customer lookup; that only adds waste
- only skip step 1 when the prompt already provides the exact invoice id
- do not insert:
  - `GET /customer`
  - `GET /invoice/{id}`
  - manual voucher reads/reversals
  - manual negative-invoice creation

## Locate Rules

- `GET /invoice` only returns charged outgoing invoices, which is the right family for this task shape
- use a wide but bounded date window
- when filtering locally, check both invoice-level and nested line-level fields
- if the same description appears in both top-level and nested line arrays on one invoice, dedupe at the invoice level
- prefer exact string matching on the prompt’s description before broader fuzzy matching
- if the locate result is ambiguous, only then add one extra targeted resolver such as `GET /customer?organizationNumber=...&fields=*`

## Send And Verification Rules

- default to `sendToCustomer=false`
- do not rely on the endpoint default, because the default is sending-enabled and can trigger unintended dispatch behavior
- the write response can already prove success when it returns a credit-note invoice object with:
  - `isCreditNote=true`
  - `creditedInvoice=<original id>`
- do not spend a follow-up `GET /invoice/{id}` when that write response already proves the reversal

## Avoidable Mistakes

- do not guess the action path as `:credit`; the verified endpoint is `:createCreditNote`
- do not fetch the customer separately when one `GET /invoice` already contains `customer.organizationNumber`
- do not treat duplicate description hits from `orderLines[]` plus `orders[].orderLines[]` on the same invoice as proof that multiple invoices matched
- do not use a voucher reversal for this task shape; voucher reversal belongs to payment-reversal workflows
- do not create a manual negative invoice as a substitute for the built-in credit-note action
- do not leave `sendToCustomer` at the default when the task only asks to issue the credit note, not send it
