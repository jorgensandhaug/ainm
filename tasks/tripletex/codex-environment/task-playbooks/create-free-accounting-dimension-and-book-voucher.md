# Create Free Accounting Dimension and Book Voucher

## Scope

Use for tasks like:
- create one free accounting dimension with a prompt-provided name
- create one or more prompt-provided values under that dimension
- then book one simple manual voucher
- attach one voucher posting to one of the newly created dimension values

Do not use for:
- supplier-invoice registration
- customer-invoice flows
- project, payroll, or travel-expense flows
- update, delete, or reversal tasks on existing dimensions or vouchers

## Verified Findings

Verified in persistent sandbox on 2026-03-20:
- `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionName` succeeded with only `dimensionName` and `active=true`
- the same endpoint returned `422` when `dimensionName` exceeded `20` characters, so prompt names must fit as-is
- `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionValue` succeeded with the minimal payload:
  - `dimensionIndex`
  - `displayName`
  - `active=true`
  - `showInVoucherRegistration=true`
- the same value-create response returned `number=null` and auto-assigned `position`, so `number` and `position` are not required for the standard create path
- `PUT /ledger/accountingDimensionValue/list` is batch update only, not batch create, so there is no trusted batch shortcut for creating the requested values
- the dimension-name create response assigned `dimensionIndex=2` in one persistent-sandbox run and `dimensionIndex=3` in a later same-day re-verification, so the voucher-link field must always be derived from the returned index instead of assuming `freeAccountingDimension1`
- `POST /ledger/voucher` failed with `422` when the posting account was sent only as `account: { "number": "7000" }`
- the validation message was:
  - `postings.account.name: Kan ikke være null.`
- the same number-only failure reproduced again with ordinary expense account `6590`
- the same number-only failure reproduced again with ordinary expense account `6860`
- the same number-only failure reproduced again with ordinary expense account `6300`
- the same number-only failure reproduced again with ordinary expense account `7300`
- the same number-only failure reproduced again with ordinary expense account `6340`
- one decisive `GET /ledger/account?number=7000,1920&fields=*` resolved the safe account ids
- that account lookup returns `account.number` as an integer in the response; local filters must compare numerically, not as strings
- `POST /ledger/voucher` then succeeded with:
  - `voucherType=null`
  - a debit posting on `7000`
  - a balancing credit posting on `1920`
  - `freeAccountingDimension1={ "id": ... }` on the target posting
- same-day re-verification for the exact `6590` task shape also succeeded with:
  - dimension name `KS154433946`
  - values `Innkjøp` and `Logistikk`
  - linked posting field `freeAccountingDimension3={ "id": 15519 }`
  - voucher `608827949`
- later same-day re-verification for the exact `6860` task shape reused existing dimension value `15253`, confirmed the same `422 postings.account.name: Kan ikke være null.` on the number-only shortcut, then succeeded immediately after `GET /ledger/account?number=6860,1920&fields=*` with voucher `608829214`
- the 2026-03-20 production run for exact prompt `Marked` / `Privat` / `Offentlig` / `6300` / `44950` succeeded on the first attempt with the standard five-call path, created the new dimension and both new values, and posted the voucher against the newly created `Offentlig` value
- a same-day persistent-sandbox re-proof for account `6300` had to reuse an existing dimension value only because all three sandbox free-dimension slots were already occupied; the number-only voucher shortcut still failed with `422 postings.account.name: Kan ikke være null.`, and the next id-based voucher write succeeded with voucher `608864963`
- the later 2026-03-20 production run for exact prompt `Marked` / `Offentlig` / `Privat` / `7300` / `37250` also succeeded on the first attempt with the same five-call path and linked the voucher posting to the newly created `Privat` value
- a later same-day persistent-sandbox re-proof for account `7300` also found the sandbox already full on free dimensions, reused existing value `15253` only for voucher-path verification, reproduced the same `422 postings.account.name: Kan ikke være null.` on the number-only shortcut, then succeeded immediately after `GET /ledger/account?number=7300,1920&fields=*` with voucher `608867443`
- the later 2026-03-20 production run for exact prompt `Marked` / `Offentlig` / `Privat` / `6340` / `25200` also succeeded on the first attempt with the same five-call path and linked the voucher posting to the newly created `Offentlig` value
- a later same-day persistent-sandbox reflection for account `6340` also found the sandbox already full on free dimensions, reused existing value `15253` only for voucher-path verification, reproduced the same `422 postings.account.name: Kan ikke være null.` on the number-only shortcut, then succeeded immediately after `GET /ledger/account?number=6340,1920&fields=*` with voucher `608868815`
- across those same-day production runs, the linked voucher value was not tied to create order: one run linked the first created value and another linked the second, so the local resolver must choose the value by exact returned `displayName`, not by index or assumed position
- the successful voucher write response already proved the linked free-dimension value id and the booked amounts
- the persistent sandbox later returned `422 Maximum of 3 accounting dimensions allowed` on `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionName` once all three free-dimension slots were occupied; that is a real account-state blocker, not a cue to add search/update/delete calls in a production create-only run
- persistent sandbox re-verified on 2026-03-21: `POST /ledger/voucher` without `row` on postings → `422 Posteringene på rad 0 (guiRow 0) er systemgenererte`; adding only `row: 1` and `row: 2` → `201`; `date`, `description`, and `currency` on individual postings are optional (Tripletex auto-fills them from the voucher-level values)
- the 2026-03-21 production run for exact prompt `Prosjekttype` / `Forskning` / `Internt` / `7000` / `32550` hit this exact `row` trap: first voucher attempt without `row` → 422, retry with `row: 1`/`row: 2` → 201, final score 2.96/4 (6 calls instead of 5, 1 avoidable 422)
- the later 2026-03-21 production run for exact prompt `Region` / `Sør-Norge` / `Midt-Norge` / `6540` / `5150` succeeded on the first attempt with the standard five-call path (0 errors), returned `dimensionIndex=1`, and linked the voucher posting to the newly created `Sør-Norge` value with voucher `609087109` — first perfect-efficiency run for this task shape
- same-day sandbox re-verification: `POST /ledger/voucher` with `account: { number: 6540, name: "Inventar" }` (no id) → `422 Internt felt (account)`; with `account: { id: 0, number: 6540, name: "Inventar" }` → same `422`; account id resolution via GET is mandatory
- the later 2026-03-21 production run for exact prompt `Kostsenter` / `IT` / `HR` / `6590` / `38100` succeeded on the first attempt with the standard five-call path (0 errors), returned `dimensionIndex=1`, and linked the voucher posting to the newly created `HR` value with voucher `609093249` — second consecutive perfect-efficiency run
- same-day sandbox re-verification: `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionValue/list` (batch create) → `400 Method Not Allowed`; `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionValue` with array body → `422`; batch value creation is not supported, confirming 5 calls is the proven minimum
- the later 2026-03-21 production run for exact prompt `Prosjekttype` / `Utvikling` / `Internt` / `7000` / `39700` succeeded on the first attempt with the standard five-call path (0 errors), returned `dimensionIndex=1`, and linked the voucher posting to the newly created `Internt` value with voucher `609185199` — third consecutive perfect-efficiency run for this task shape
- the later 2026-03-21 production run for exact prompt `Marked` / `Bedrift` / `Privat` / `6590` / `16750` (Portuguese prompt) succeeded on the first attempt with the standard five-call path (0 errors), returned `dimensionIndex=1`, and linked the voucher posting to the newly created `Bedrift` value with voucher `609186850` — fourth consecutive perfect-efficiency run for this task shape
- the later 2026-03-21 production run for exact prompt `Prosjekttype` / `Internt` / `Utvikling` / `6340` / `44500` (German prompt) succeeded on the first attempt with the standard five-call path (0 errors), returned `dimensionIndex=1`, and linked the voucher posting to the newly created `Internt` value with voucher `609190710` — fifth consecutive perfect-efficiency run for this task shape
- the later 2026-03-21 production run for exact prompt `Prosjekttype` / `Eksternt` / `Forskning` / `7140` / `28850` (Norwegian prompt) succeeded on the first attempt with the standard five-call path (0 errors), returned `dimensionIndex=1`, and linked the voucher posting to the newly created `Forskning` value with voucher `609193835` — sixth consecutive perfect-efficiency run; confirms account `7140` works identically
- the later 2026-03-21 production run for exact prompt `Region` / `Midt-Norge` / `Vestlandet` / `7140` / `43750` (Nynorsk prompt) succeeded on the first attempt with the standard five-call path (0 errors), returned `dimensionIndex=1`, and linked the voucher posting to the newly created `Midt-Norge` value with voucher `609201418` — seventh consecutive perfect-efficiency run

## Minimal Safe Flow

1. Confirm these operations in `./openapi.json`
   - `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionName`
   - `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionValue`
   - `GET /ledger/account`
   - `POST /ledger/voucher`
2. Create the dimension
   - `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionName`
3. Create the requested values
   - `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionValue` once per value
   - reuse the returned `dimensionIndex`
4. Resolve the voucher accounts
   - `GET /ledger/account?number=<target-account>,1920&fields=*`
5. Create the manual voucher
   - `POST /ledger/voucher`
   - link the chosen value through `freeAccountingDimension1`, `freeAccountingDimension2`, or `freeAccountingDimension3` based on the created dimension index
6. Verify from the write responses
7. Stop

## Exact-Match Fast Path

- For a prompt that:
  - asks to create one new free dimension
  - provides the requested value names directly
  - then asks for one plain voucher posting on one ledger account tied to one of those new values
- the winning path is still:
  1. `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionName`
  2. `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionValue`
  3. `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionValue`
  4. `GET /ledger/account?number=<target-account>,1920&fields=*`
  5. `POST /ledger/voucher`
- do not spend a pre-read of existing dimensions in a scored create task
- do not try `account.number` directly on voucher postings just to save the account lookup; that path was re-tested and failed, so there is no trusted four-call shortcut for this exact task shape
- do not chase `/ledger/accountingDimensionValue/list` as a multi-value create optimization; it is update-only and does not reduce the call count for this task shape
- do not add a speculative `GET /ledger/accountingDimensionName` or `GET /ledger/accountingDimensionValue/search` in a fresh-account create task just to guard against local script bugs; the minimal production path is still five calls, and local filtering bugs should be fixed in code rather than repaired with extra Tripletex reads
- if a persistent sandbox is already full on free dimensions during reflection, keep any search/reuse branch confined to the research script; it is not part of the scored fresh-account playbook

## Winning Payload Shape

Dimension create:

```json
{
  "dimensionName": "Prosjekttype",
  "active": true
}
```

Dimension value create:

```json
{
  "dimensionIndex": 1,
  "displayName": "Internt",
  "active": true,
  "showInVoucherRegistration": true
}
```

Voucher create (true minimal shape — `date`, `description`, `currency` on postings are optional):

```json
{
  "date": "2026-03-21",
  "description": "Bilag konto 7000, Prosjekttype \"Internt\"",
  "voucherType": null,
  "postings": [
    {
      "row": 1,
      "account": { "id": 424191158 },
      "amount": 39700,
      "amountCurrency": 39700,
      "amountGross": 39700,
      "amountGrossCurrency": 39700,
      "freeAccountingDimension1": { "id": 15250 }
    },
    {
      "row": 2,
      "account": { "id": 424190862 },
      "amount": -39700,
      "amountCurrency": -39700,
      "amountGross": -39700,
      "amountGrossCurrency": -39700
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace the ids and amounts with the values resolved in the current account. The critical shape is: `row` starting at `1` (MANDATORY — row `0` is reserved for system-generated postings), id-based account refs, `voucherType=null`, balanced positive and negative gross amounts, and the correct `freeAccountingDimension{n}` key.

## Validation Traps

- do not send voucher posting accounts only as `account.number`; sandbox returned `422 postings.account.name: Kan ikke være null.`
- do not compare `/ledger/account` response `account.number` as a string; Tripletex returns it as an integer, and a string comparison can trigger a false missing-account branch after a correct lookup
- do not spend a speculative `GET /ledger/accountingDimensionName` in a pure create task; the create response already gives the needed `dimensionIndex`
- do not assume the created free dimension will be slot `1`; persistent sandbox assigned slot `2` on re-verification
- do not invent dimension-value `number` or `position` fields unless the prompt explicitly scores them
- do not attach the dimension value to both voucher postings unless the prompt explicitly requires that
- do not add `vatType` for the standard zero-VAT manual-voucher shape
- do not omit `row` on voucher postings; without explicit `row` values starting at `1`, Tripletex defaults to row `0` which is reserved for system-generated postings, causing `422 Posteringene på rad 0 (guiRow 0) er systemgenererte`; sandbox-verified on 2026-03-21: posting without `row` → 422, posting with only `row` added → 201
- do not append sandbox-only uniqueness suffixes that push `dimensionName` past `20` characters
- if `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionName` fails with `422 Maximum of 3 accounting dimensions allowed`, stop and treat the run as blocked by account state unless the prompt explicitly requests a reuse/update path

## Verification Shape

- `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionName` proves:
  - `dimensionName`
  - assigned `dimensionIndex`
  - active state
- each `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionValue` proves:
  - `displayName`
  - `dimensionIndex`
  - `showInVoucherRegistration`
- `POST /ledger/voucher` proves:
  - voucher id and number
  - posting amounts
  - posting account ids
  - linked `freeAccountingDimension{1|2|3}.id`
- no follow-up `GET /ledger/voucher/{id}` is needed unless the task explicitly scores expanded linked display fields that the write response omits

## Counterpart Account Rule

- if the prompt gives only the target ledger account and amount, and does not score a specific balancing account, the sandbox-proven fallback is the existing bank account `1920`
- resolve it in the same decisive `GET /ledger/account?number=<target-account>,1920&fields=*`
- if `1920` is absent from that result, do one fallback `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*` and pick the existing invoice or bank account from that response
