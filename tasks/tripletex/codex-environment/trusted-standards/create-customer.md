# Create Customer

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- create one new customer
- prompt directly provides customer identity fields
- no invoice, payment, update, delete, or lookup-heavy workflow
- at most one normal mailing address
- at most one generic email address

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- foreign organization number
- separate invoice email requested
- separate physical/visiting address requested
- task is update/delete/search-heavy
- prompt implies special invoice delivery setup

## Standard Flow
1. `POST /customer`
2. verify directly from `response.value`
3. stop

## Payload Rules
- send only prompt-required fields
- normal default shape:
  - `name`
  - `email`
  - `organizationNumber`
- if one ordinary address is given, add only:
  - `postalAddress.addressLine1`
  - `postalAddress.postalCode`
  - `postalAddress.city`
- preserve prompt text exactly, including Unicode
- do not invent `physicalAddress`
- do not invent `invoiceEmail`

## Reuse From Write Response
- `value.id`
- all returned scored customer fields
- returned defaults like `invoiceSendMethod` if later logic unexpectedly needs them
- ignore any sparse auto-generated `value.physicalAddress` link unless the prompt explicitly asked for a separate physical/visiting address

## Verification
- default verification is zero extra calls
- trust the `201` `{"value": {...}}` body
- only do a `GET` if the write response is unexpectedly missing a scored field
- if `value.physicalAddress` appears as a link-only object after sending only `postalAddress`, do not treat that as a missing-field problem

## Known Recovery Branches
- customer delivery validation if prompt explicitly implies EHF/invoice delivery constraints
- country/address consistency for foreign organization numbers

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- endpoint family verified in `./openapi.json`
- repeatedly sandbox-proven as one-call create
- re-verified on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with `postalAddress`; the same one-call write returned the scored postal fields plus a sparse auto-generated `physicalAddress` link
