# Create Free Accounting Dimension and Book Voucher

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- create one new free accounting dimension
- create one or more new values for that dimension from prompt-provided names
- then book one simple manual voucher
- the scored voucher line is one ledger-account posting linked to one of the newly created dimension values
- no supplier, customer, employee, project, VAT-specific, update, delete, or reversal flow

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- the task modifies or deletes an existing free dimension or value
- the task needs a supplier-invoice, customer-invoice, payroll, project, or travel-expense flow
- the voucher requires linked customer, supplier, employee, or project objects
- the prompt gives a special balancing-account requirement that materially differs from the standard bank-line fallback

## Standard Flow
1. `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionName`
2. `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionValue` once per requested value
3. `GET /ledger/account?number=<target-account>,1920&fields=*`
4. `POST /ledger/voucher`
5. verify from the write responses
6. stop

## Payload Rules
- on `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionName`, send:
  - `dimensionName`
  - `active: true`
- `dimensionName` is validated at max length `20`; if the prompt-provided name exceeds that, treat the run as blocked instead of truncating it
- on each `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionValue`, the minimal proven payload is:
  - `dimensionIndex`
  - `displayName`
  - `active: true`
  - `showInVoucherRegistration: true`
- do not invent `number` or `position` on the dimension values for the standard path; sandbox proved Tripletex accepts the minimal payload and auto-assigns ordering
- reuse the returned `dimensionIndex` from the dimension-name create response; persistent sandbox also assigned `2`, not only `1`
- on `POST /ledger/voucher`:
  - set `voucherType: null`
  - build a balanced two-line voucher
  - use the resolved ledger-account ids, not `account.number` alone
  - on the scored posting, attach the chosen value as `freeAccountingDimension1`, `freeAccountingDimension2`, or `freeAccountingDimension3` according to the returned `dimensionIndex`
- if the prompt gives only the target ledger account and omits the balancing account, the standard fallback is the existing bank account `1920`
- for a zero-VAT manual voucher, omit `vatType` and send the same value in:
  - `amount`
  - `amountCurrency`
  - `amountGross`
  - `amountGrossCurrency`

## Reuse From Write Response
- from `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionName`:
  - `value.id`
  - `value.dimensionIndex`
  - `value.dimensionName`
- from each `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionValue`:
  - `value.id`
  - `value.displayName`
- from `POST /ledger/voucher`:
  - `value.id`
  - `value.number`
  - the returned postings with account ids, amounts, and the linked `freeAccountingDimension{1|2|3}.id`

## Verification
- default verification is zero extra calls after the voucher write
- trust the dimension-name write response for the created dimension name and assigned `dimensionIndex`
- trust the value write responses for the created value names
- trust the voucher write response when it already proves:
  - voucher id and number
  - target posting account id
  - target posting amount
  - linked free-dimension value id
- for the exact create-dimension-plus-two-values-plus-one-voucher task shape, this five-call flow remains the minimal realistic path because the lower-call number-only voucher shortcut is not valid

## Known Recovery Branches
- if `GET /ledger/account?number=<target-account>,1920&fields=*` does not return `1920`, do one fallback `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*` and choose the existing invoice or bank account from that result
- if dimension creation fails because all three free dimensions are already in use, treat the run as blocked by account state rather than guessing an update or reuse flow
- if dimension creation fails because the free-dimension feature is disabled, treat the run as blocked by missing module or feature state unless the prompt explicitly instructs an activation step

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- `/ledger/accountingDimensionName`, `/ledger/accountingDimensionValue`, `/ledger/account`, and `/ledger/voucher` verified in `./openapi.json`
- persistent sandbox re-verified on 2026-03-20:
  - `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionName` returned `422` when `dimensionName` exceeded `20` characters
  - `POST /ledger/accountingDimensionValue` succeeded with only `dimensionIndex`, `displayName`, `active`, and `showInVoucherRegistration`
  - `POST /ledger/voucher` with `account: { "number": "7000" }` and again with `account: { "number": "6590" }` failed `422` on `postings.account.name`, so number-only account refs are not the trusted fast path
  - the id-based voucher write succeeded immediately after one decisive `GET /ledger/account?number=6590,1920&fields=*`
