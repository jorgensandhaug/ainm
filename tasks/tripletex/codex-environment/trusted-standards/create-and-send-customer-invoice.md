# Create And Send Customer Invoice

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- create one outgoing invoice
- send it as part of the same minimal flow
- invoice has one or more simple direct order lines
- prompt gives the customer identity directly or the customer is resolvable in one decisive read
- prompt does not require a specific send channel override such as a forced email address

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- prompt requires a specific send channel that is not already safely implied by known customer data
- prompt requires an existing-product lookup-heavy flow
- task is payment, reversal, or correction

## Standard Flow
1. if the prompt explicitly identifies an already-existing customer, resolve that customer in one decisive `GET /customer?...&fields=*`; otherwise, in the normal fresh-account variant, create the customer directly
2. if creating a new customer and the prompt gives no email or postal address, `POST /customer` with:
   - `name`
   - `organizationNumber`
   - `invoiceSendMethod: "MANUAL"`
3. resolve `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=<invoice-date>&fields=*`
4. `POST /invoice` and let the default `sendToCustomer=true` handle the send in the same write
5. only if that invoice write fails with missing company bank account:
   - `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*`
   - `PUT /ledger/account/{id}` with a checksum-valid unique 11-digit `bankAccountNumber`
   - retry the same `POST /invoice` once
6. stop

## Payload Rules
- include:
  - `invoiceDate`
  - `invoiceDueDate`
  - `customer: { "id": ... }`
  - `orders[].customer`
  - `orders[].orderDate`
  - `orders[].deliveryDate`
  - `orders[].orderLines`
- create lines under `orders[].orderLines`, not `invoice.orderLines`
- do not hardcode output VAT code `3`
- do not omit direct-line `vatType` just to save the VAT lookup; a successful write can still create the wrong VAT outcome
- for explicit no-VAT / `0%` direct-line prompts, still resolve the current account's filtered outgoing `0%` VAT row instead of assuming omission is equivalent
- for ordinary direct-line services explicitly priced excluding VAT / MVA, select an exact `25%` row from the filtered outgoing VAT result; if no such row exists, treat the task as blocked in that account instead of falling back to `0%`
- if creating the customer with no delivery/contact details, prefer `invoiceSendMethod: "MANUAL"` and let the invoice create do the send attempt

## Reuse From Write Response
- `customer.value.id`
- `invoice.value.id`
- `invoice.value.invoiceNumber`
- totals from the invoice write response

## Verification
- default verification is zero extra calls
- treat a successful `POST /invoice` with default `sendToCustomer=true` as the winning send path for this task shape
- do not add an automatic follow-up `PUT /invoice/{id}/:send`

## Known Recovery Branches
- if invoice creation fails with missing company bank account:
  - repair the existing invoice bank account and retry the same invoice write once
- if the prompt explicitly identifies an already-existing customer, use one decisive customer read instead of blind customer create

## Known Pitfalls
- do not spend `GET /customer` first on the normal fresh-account new-customer variant
- do not treat wording like `invoice customer <name> (<organizationNumber>)` as proof that the customer already exists; when the prompt only supplies business identity and the environment implies a fresh account, the winning path is still direct `POST /customer`
- do not branch into `PUT /invoice/{id}/:send?sendType=MANUAL` as the default path; sandbox reproduced `500` on 2026-03-20 while the same task shape succeeded through `POST /invoice` with default send behavior
- do not assume sparse `postalAddress` or `physicalAddress` links on the customer prove that `PAPER` send is available; sandbox returned `422 Faktura kan ikke sendes via PAPER`
- do not assume organization number alone proves EHF sendability; production returned `422 Faktura kan ikke sendes via EHF`
- do not treat a successful `POST /invoice` without `orderLines[].vatType` as proof that VAT is correct; persistent sandbox on 2026-03-20 accepted that lower-call write and created `amountCurrency == amountExcludingVatCurrency` (`28500`) on the same task shape
- for the exact one-line no-VAT service shape with prompt-only `name + organizationNumber + amount + description`, do not add a speculative customer lookup before the customer create; persistent sandbox re-verification on 2026-03-20 succeeded in `3` calls with `POST /customer`, filtered `GET /ledger/vatType`, then `POST /invoice`
- the same exact no-VAT branch also covers Portuguese wording such as `sem IVA`; the 2026-03-20 production run for `Porto Alegre Lda` / `842889154` / `Consultoria de dados` / `11200` used the same `3` calls and did not need `GET /customer` or `PUT /invoice/{id}/:send`
- for ordinary one-line service prompts that explicitly price the work excluding VAT / MVA, do not take the first filtered VAT row if it is `0%`; the safe branch is exact `25%` selection or a blocked conclusion for that account
- French wording such as `hors TVA` belongs to that same taxed ex-VAT branch, not the no-VAT branch. The 2026-03-20 production run for `Colline SARL` / `944164340` / `Service réseau` / `44750` succeeded in the canonical `3` calls, while the same-day persistent sandbox still exposed only `0%`, produced a wrong untaxed `44750` total when `vatType` was omitted, and rejected hardcoded `vatType.id=3` with `422`.

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- `/customer`, `/invoice`, `/ledger/vatType`, and `/ledger/account` verified in `./openapi.json`
- minimal create-and-send path re-verified in persistent sandbox on 2026-03-20:
  - `POST /customer` with `invoiceSendMethod: "MANUAL"` succeeded
  - `POST /invoice` with default `sendToCustomer=true` succeeded for the same customer
  - explicit later `PUT /invoice/{id}/:send?sendType=MANUAL` reproduced `500`
  - explicit later `PUT /invoice/{id}/:send?sendType=PAPER` reproduced `422`
- VAT handling re-verified in persistent sandbox on 2026-03-20 for the same one-line service invoice shape:
  - `POST /invoice` without line `vatType` succeeded but created a no-VAT invoice (`amountExcludingVatCurrency=28500`, `amountCurrency=28500`)
  - `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=2026-03-20&fields=*` returned only VAT code `6` (`0%`)
  - hardcoded line `vatType.id=3` failed with `422 ... Ugyldig mva-kode.`
- exact ordinary-service ex-VAT create-and-send shape re-confirmed across production plus sandbox on 2026-03-20:
  - production run `Snøhetta AS` / `871844062` / `Webdesign` / `20100` succeeded in the canonical `3` calls: `POST /customer` with `invoiceSendMethod=MANUAL`, filtered outgoing VAT read, then `POST /invoice`
  - the production invoice write already proved the intended taxed outcome with `amountExcludingVatCurrency=20100` and `amountCurrency=25125`
  - the persistent sandbox still exposed only VAT code `6` (`0%`) for the same date, so the exact same prompt shape would be blocked there for standard VAT rather than downgraded to `0%`
  - the French prompt variant `Colline SARL` / `944164340` / `Service réseau` / `44750` / `hors TVA` succeeded in the same canonical `3` calls in production and confirms that `hors TVA` must be normalized to ordinary taxed ex-VAT handling, not `0%`
  - the same-day persistent sandbox re-check on analogous org `944164341` again exposed only VAT code `6`, created a wrong untaxed `44750` total when `orderLines[].vatType` was omitted, and rejected hardcoded `vatType.id=3` with `422 Ugyldig mva-kode.`
  - the later same-day French production run `Lumière SARL` / `959714320` / `Stockage cloud` / `34100` again finished on the same exact `3` calls and preserved the Unicode customer name exactly as prompted
  - the same-day persistent sandbox analog `Lumière Reflection b9572091 SARL` / `957223729` still exposed only VAT code `6` (`0%`); for that exact `34100` line, omitting `orderLines[].vatType` created a wrong untaxed `34100` total, so that sandbox account remains blocked for the taxed branch rather than a valid shortcut
- exact no-VAT direct-line create-and-send shape re-verified in persistent sandbox on 2026-03-20:
  - fresh-account-style branch: on the same one-line `22700` / `Design web` / `0%` shape, direct `POST /customer` with `invoiceSendMethod=MANUAL`, then `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=2026-03-20&fields=*`, then `POST /invoice` succeeded without any customer pre-read
  - the filtered VAT read returned only code `6` (`0%`)
  - the invoice write returned `amountExcludingVatCurrency=22700`, `amountCurrency=22700`, and an invoice number without any extra verification read
  - on the exact `Porto Alegre Lda` / `826870192` task identity, once that customer existed in sandbox, the existing-customer branch also succeeded with one decisive `GET /customer?organizationNumber=826870192&fields=*`, the same filtered VAT read, and the same invoice write
- exact Portuguese no-VAT direct-line create-and-send shape re-confirmed across production plus persistent sandbox on 2026-03-20:
  - production run `Porto Alegre Lda` / `842889154` / `Consultoria de dados` / `11200` / `sem IVA` succeeded in the canonical `3` calls: direct `POST /customer` with `invoiceSendMethod=MANUAL`, filtered outgoing VAT read, then `POST /invoice`
  - the production invoice write already proved the intended no-VAT outcome with `amountExcludingVatCurrency=11200` and `amountCurrency=11200`
  - persistent sandbox re-check on the analogous fresh-customer `842889155` shape returned VAT code `6` (`0%`) and the same `11200` / `11200` totals through the same `3` calls, again without any customer pre-read or explicit `:send` call
