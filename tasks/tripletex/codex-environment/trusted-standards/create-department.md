# Create Department

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- create one or more new departments
- prompt directly provides department names
- no update/delete/lookup flow
- prompt language does not matter for this shape; German, Norwegian, Spanish, French, etc. still use the same endpoint choice

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- prompt requires modifying existing departments
- prompt depends on department manager or other linked objects
- task is not a pure create

## Standard Flow
1. if one department: `POST /department`
2. if several departments: `POST /department/list` once with the full array
3. verify directly from write response
4. stop

## Payload Rules
- one department:
  - `{ "name": "..." }`
- many departments:
  - `[{"name":"..."}, ...]`
- preserve department names exactly, including non-ASCII letters such as `Ø`
- do not invent `departmentNumber`
- do not invent `departmentManager`

## Reuse From Write Response
- `value.id` or `values[].id`
- returned `name`, `displayName`, `isInactive`

## Verification
- zero extra calls by default
- trust `201` write wrapper
- for batch create, trust `values[]`
- do not reject a successful batch write just because top-level `fullResultSize` is `0`
- do not add a follow-up `GET /department` or split the work into repeated `POST /department` calls for a plain multi-create prompt

## Known Recovery Branches
- none for the standard create shape

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- `/department` and `/department/list` verified in `./openapi.json`
- sandbox-proven for one-call single and one-call batch create
- sandbox re-verified on 2026-03-20: batch create returned correct `values[]` with `fullResultSize=0`
- sandbox re-verified on 2026-03-20 with `Lager`, `Økonomi`, `Drift`-shaped names: one `POST /department/list` preserved the exact Unicode names in `values[]`
- production re-confirmed on 2026-03-20 with a German three-department prompt: one `POST /department/list` created all requested departments with no prerequisite reads
- production re-confirmed on 2026-03-20 with a Spanish three-department prompt for `Lager`, `Økonomi`, and `Drift`: one `POST /department/list` created all requested departments with no prerequisite reads
- production re-confirmed on 2026-03-20 with a Norwegian three-department prompt for `HR`, `Salg`, and `Økonomi`: one `POST /department/list` remained the exact minimal path and preserved the prompt names in `values[]`
