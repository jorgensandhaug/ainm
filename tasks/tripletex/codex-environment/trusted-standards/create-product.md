# Create Product

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- create one new product
- prompt directly gives name and price
- product is a standard outgoing-sales product
- task does not require advanced product setup

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- prompt requires inventory/stock behavior
- prompt requires special product accounting fields
- task depends on existing linked entities
- VAT setup is ambiguous and prompt requires an exact percentage not implied by account defaults

## Standard Flow
1. if the task is the exact fresh-account shape "create one product with prompt-provided `name`, `number`, excluding-VAT price, and standard `25%` VAT", do one `POST /product` with only the requested fields and no explicit `vatType`
2. verify directly from `response.value`
3. stop
4. otherwise, if the prompt requires a non-default or non-standard exact VAT selection, do one decisive `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=<date>&fields=*`
5. select the row whose `percentage` exactly matches the prompt
6. `POST /product`
7. verify directly from `response.value`
8. stop

## Payload Rules
- send only prompt-required fields
- usually:
  - `name`
  - `number` when the prompt gives a product number
  - `priceExcludingVatCurrency` or the exact corresponding price field required by prompt/playbook
- for the exact fresh-account standard-`25%` product-create prompt, the canonical winning path is one `POST /product` with no explicit `vatType`
- on that one-call shortcut, verify from the write response that `priceIncludingVatCurrency` reflects `25%` VAT and that Tripletex returned a `vatType`
- do not use that one-call shortcut for exact `0%`, reduced-rate, or otherwise non-standard VAT prompts
- if exact VAT must be resolved rather than inherited from the fresh-account default, resolve `vatType` from the filtered outgoing VAT list on the real date
- do not re-read `./openapi.json` for an exact trusted-standard match
- do not add `GET /product` pre-reads or `GET /product/{id}` verification reads for a pure create task
- do not rely on omitting `vatType` even if a sandbox account auto-fills a 0% default
- do not hardcode VAT code `3`
- do not use unfiltered VAT catalog
- do not search for a book-specific product subtype or extra accounting field just because the prompt says "0% for books"; still pick the matching 0% row from the filtered `OUTGOING` result
- if the requested VAT percentage is absent from the filtered `OUTGOING` result, treat the task as blocked in that account; do not substitute a same-percentage code from the broader catalog

## Reuse From Write Response
- `value.id`
- returned product number/name/price/vat fields

## Verification
- zero extra calls if write response proves scored fields
- if a VAT lookup was needed, keep it to one decisive `GET`

## Known Recovery Branches
- if product create rejects VAT type, re-check against filtered `OUTGOING` VAT list only
- if filtered `OUTGOING` still does not contain the requested percentage, stop instead of guessing another `vatType`
- if a sandbox-only shortcut without `vatType` appears to auto-fill the desired VAT, do not promote that to the trusted path for scored exact-VAT tasks

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- `/product` verified in `./openapi.json`
- VAT selection rule proven in sandbox/playbooks
- scoring feedback on 2026-03-20 confirmed that the exact `Stockage cloud` `25%` product-create task lost efficiency when it spent a filtered `OUTGOING` VAT read before `POST /product`; the lower-call winning path for that exact fresh-account shape is one `POST /product`
- persistent-sandbox verification on 2026-03-20 showed that `POST /product` without `vatType` auto-filled `0%` VAT code `6`, so the one-call shortcut is account-dependent and must stay scoped to the exact fresh-account standard-`25%` shape
- persistent-sandbox verification on 2026-03-20 still exposed only `0%` on the filtered `OUTGOING` VAT read; that account remains blocked for explicit `25%` VAT resolution
