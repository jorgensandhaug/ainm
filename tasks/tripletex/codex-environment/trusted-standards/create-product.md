# Create Product

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- create one new product
- prompt directly gives name and price
- prompt directly gives the product number when one is required
- product is a standard outgoing-sales product
- localized excluding-VAT wording such as Portuguese `sem IVA`, Spanish `sin IVA`, German `ohne MwSt.`, Norwegian (Bokmål/Nynorsk) `eksklusiv MVA` / `eks. MVA`, or French `hors TVA` still clearly maps to the excluding-VAT price field
- task does not require advanced product setup

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- prompt requires inventory/stock behavior
- prompt requires special product accounting fields
- task depends on existing linked entities
- VAT setup is ambiguous and prompt requires an exact percentage not implied by account defaults

## Standard Flow
1. if the task is the exact fresh-account shape "create one product with prompt-provided `name`, `number`, excluding-VAT price, and standard `25%` VAT", do one `POST /product` with only the requested fields and no explicit `vatType`
2. verify directly from `response.value`
3. stop
4. otherwise, if the prompt requires a non-default or non-standard exact VAT selection, do one decisive `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=<date>&fields=*`
5. select the row whose `percentage` exactly matches the prompt
6. `POST /product`
7. verify directly from `response.value`
8. stop

## Payload Rules
- send only prompt-required fields
- usually:
  - `name`
  - `number` when the prompt gives a product number
  - `priceExcludingVatCurrency` or the exact corresponding price field required by prompt/playbook
- for the exact fresh-account standard-`25%` product-create prompt, the canonical winning path is one `POST /product` with no explicit `vatType`
- on that one-call shortcut, verify from the write response that `priceIncludingVatCurrency` reflects `25%` VAT and that Tripletex returned a `vatType`
- do not use that one-call shortcut for exact `0%`, reduced-rate, or otherwise non-standard VAT prompts
- if exact VAT must be resolved rather than inherited from the fresh-account default, resolve `vatType` from the filtered outgoing VAT list on the real date
- do not re-read `./openapi.json` for an exact trusted-standard match
- do not add `GET /product` pre-reads or `GET /product/{id}` verification reads for a pure create task
- do not rely on omitting `vatType` even if a sandbox account auto-fills a 0% default
- do not hardcode VAT code `3`
- do not use unfiltered VAT catalog
- do not pick the first broad-catalog row whose `percentage` matches; the 2026-03-20 persistent sandbox broad list surfaced `15%` rows `11`, `31`, `551`, and `556`, where the first hit `11` was incoming VAT rather than the product-usable outgoing base code
- do not search for a category-specific product subtype or extra accounting field just because the prompt says "0% for books" or "0% for newspapers" or "15% for næringsmidler (food)" or similar; the category qualifier is cosmetic and does not change the VAT resolution logic; still pick the matching percentage row from the filtered `OUTGOING` result
- if the requested VAT percentage is absent from the filtered `OUTGOING` result, treat the task as blocked in that account; do not substitute a same-percentage code from the broader catalog

## Reuse From Write Response
- `value.id`
- returned product number/name/price/vat fields

## Verification
- zero extra calls if write response proves scored fields
- if a VAT lookup was needed, keep it to one decisive `GET`

## Known Recovery Branches
- if product create rejects VAT type, re-check against filtered `OUTGOING` VAT list only
- if filtered `OUTGOING` still does not contain the requested percentage, stop instead of guessing another `vatType`
- if a sandbox-only shortcut without `vatType` appears to auto-fill the desired VAT, do not promote that to the trusted path for scored exact-VAT tasks

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- `/product` verified in `./openapi.json`
- VAT selection rule proven in sandbox/playbooks
- scoring feedback on 2026-03-20 confirmed that the exact `Stockage cloud` `25%` product-create task lost efficiency when it spent a filtered `OUTGOING` VAT read before `POST /product`; the lower-call winning path for that exact fresh-account shape is one `POST /product`
- fresh-account production verification on 2026-03-20 for `Softwarelizenz` / `7986` / `24900` excluding VAT confirmed that the one-call path still returns the correct `25%` outcome directly from the write response (`priceIncludingVatCurrency=31125`, `vatType.id=3`)
- fresh-account production verification on 2026-03-20 for the Portuguese prompt `Sessão de formação` / `6378` / `37050` `sem IVA` / standard `25%` also succeeded with one `POST /product`, returning `priceIncludingVatCurrency=46312.5` and `vatType.id=3`
- fresh-account production verification on 2026-03-20 for the French prompt `Maintenance` / `1327` / `3700 NOK hors TVA` / standard `25%` also succeeded with one `POST /product`, returning `priceIncludingVatCurrency=4625` and `vatType.id=3`
- fresh-account production verification on 2026-03-20 for the Spanish prompt `Mantenimiento` / `7266` / `650 NOK sin IVA` / standard `25%` also succeeded with one `POST /product`, returning `priceIncludingVatCurrency=812.5` and `vatType.id=3`
- persistent-sandbox verification on 2026-03-20 showed that `POST /product` without `vatType` auto-filled `0%` VAT code `6`, so the one-call shortcut is account-dependent and must stay scoped to the exact fresh-account standard-`25%` shape
- persistent-sandbox re-verification on 2026-03-20 still exposed only `0%` on the filtered `OUTGOING` VAT read, and the omitted-`vatType` create still produced `priceIncludingVatCurrency == priceExcludingVatCurrency`; that account remains blocked for explicit `25%` VAT resolution
- persistent-sandbox re-verification later on 2026-03-20 with the same `37050` price and Portuguese naming still returned only `OUTGOING` VAT row `id=6` / `0%`, and the omitted-`vatType` create again auto-filled `vatType.id=6` with `priceIncludingVatCurrency=37050`
- persistent-sandbox re-verification on 2026-03-20 for the same French `Maintenance` / `3700` shape again returned only `OUTGOING` VAT row `id=6` / `0%`, and an omitted-`vatType` create auto-filled `vatType.id=6` with `priceIncludingVatCurrency=3700`; that sandbox still cannot prove an exact `25%` product create and remains blocked for explicit `25%` resolution
- persistent-sandbox re-verification on 2026-03-20 for the same Spanish `Mantenimiento` / `650 sin IVA` shape again returned only `OUTGOING` VAT row `id=6` / `0%`, and an omitted-`vatType` create auto-filled `vatType.id=6` with `priceIncludingVatCurrency=650`; that sandbox still cannot prove an exact `25%` product create and remains blocked for explicit `25%` resolution
- fresh-account production verification on 2026-03-21 for the French prompt `Journal quotidien` / `9219` / `3150 NOK hors TVA` / `0%` VAT for newspapers succeeded with 2-call path: `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING` resolved `id=5` for `0%`, then `POST /product` returned `priceIncludingVatCurrency=3150` and `vatType.id=5`; scored 2/2 (perfect), confirming the 2-call path is optimal for explicit 0% VAT tasks
- fresh-account production verification on 2026-03-21 for the Portuguese prompt `Livro de receitas` / `7946` / `18250 NOK sem IVA` / `0%` VAT for books succeeded with the same 2-call path: `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING` resolved `id=5` for `0%`, then `POST /product` returned `priceIncludingVatCurrency=18250` and `vatType.id=5`; 2 calls 0 errors, confirming the 2-call path is consistently optimal for explicit 0% VAT tasks across languages (French/Portuguese) and category qualifiers (newspapers/books)
- fresh-account production verification on 2026-03-21 for the German prompt `Datenberatung` / `7855` / `41550 NOK ohne MwSt.` / standard `25%` succeeded with one `POST /product`, returning `priceIncludingVatCurrency=51937.5` and `vatType.id=3`; 7th consecutive production confirmation of the one-call path for the exact fresh-account standard-25% shape across languages: de/en/es/pt/fr
- fresh-account production verification on 2026-03-21 for the Norwegian prompt `Eplejuice` / `9026` / `49700 kr eksklusiv MVA` / `15%` VAT for næringsmidler (food) succeeded with the 2-call path: `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING` resolved `id=31` for `15%` (`Utgående avgift, middels sats`), then `POST /product` returned `priceIncludingVatCurrency=57155` and `vatType.id=31`; 2 calls 0 errors; first production confirmation of the 2-call path for explicit 15% reduced-rate VAT; confirms that category qualifiers like "næringsmidler" are cosmetic and the `OUTGOING` filter correctly surfaces `id=31` for 15% in fresh accounts
- fresh-account production verification on 2026-03-21 for the English prompt `Training Session` / `7908` / `26250 NOK excluding VAT` / standard `25%` succeeded with one `POST /product`, returning `priceIncludingVatCurrency=32812.5` and `vatType.id=3`; 8th consecutive production confirmation of the one-call path for the exact fresh-account standard-25% shape; second English-language confirmation
- fresh-account production verification on 2026-03-21 for the English prompt `Web Design` / `3766` / `23950 NOK excluding VAT` / standard `25%` succeeded with one `POST /product`, returning `priceIncludingVatCurrency=29937.5` and `vatType.id=3`; 9th consecutive production confirmation of the one-call path for the exact fresh-account standard-25% shape; third English-language confirmation
- fresh-account production verification on 2026-03-21 for the English prompt `Training Session` / `2451` / `20350 NOK excluding VAT` / standard `25%` succeeded with one `POST /product`, returning `priceIncludingVatCurrency=25437.5` and `vatType.id=3`; 10th consecutive production confirmation of the one-call path for the exact fresh-account standard-25% shape; fourth English-language confirmation; second confirmation of product name `Training Session` (previously verified with number `7908` / price `26250`)
- fresh-account production verification on 2026-03-21 for the Nynorsk prompt `Avis` / `2061` / `4150 kr eksklusiv MVA` / `0%` VAT for newspapers succeeded with the 2-call path: `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING` resolved `id=5` for `0%`, then `POST /product` returned `priceIncludingVatCurrency=4150` and `vatType.id=5`; 2 calls 0 errors, scored 2/2 (perfect); 3rd production confirmation of the 2-call path for explicit 0% VAT; first Nynorsk (`nn`) language confirmation; extends proven 0% language set from {fr, pt} to {fr, pt, nn}
- persistent-sandbox verification on 2026-03-21 confirmed the sandbox still has only `OUTGOING` VAT row `id=6` / `0%`; sandbox remains blocked for 15% and 25% VAT product verification
