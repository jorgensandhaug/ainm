# Create Supplier

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- create one new supplier
- prompt directly provides supplier identity fields
- no supplier invoice, payment, update, delete, or lookup-heavy workflow
- at most one generic email address

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- separate invoice email requested
- prompt requires postal, physical, or delivery address details
- foreign/company-setup edge case forces extra address or country fields
- task is update/delete/search-heavy

## Standard Flow
1. `POST /supplier`
2. verify directly from `response.value`
3. stop

## Exact-Match Fast Path
- for the plain supplier-create shape, the winning API path is exactly one write:
  - `POST /supplier`
- do not spend a pre-read on `/supplier`
- do not spend a follow-up read on `/supplier/{id}` when `response.value` already contains the scored fields
- do not spend scored-run time re-checking `./task-playbooks/create-supplier.md` or `./openapi.json` when this trusted standard already matches exactly

## Payload Rules
- send only prompt-required fields
- normal default shape:
  - `name`
  - `organizationNumber`
  - `email`
- if the lone supplier email is invoice-looking, use this corrected low-call shape instead:
  - `name`
  - `organizationNumber`
  - `email`
  - `invoiceEmail`
- preserve prompt text exactly, including Unicode
- map one generic prompt email to `email`
- treat localized generic email labels such as `Correo electrónico` the same as `Email`/`E-post`; they still map to `email`
- if that lone supplier email also clearly looks invoice-oriented, such as `faktura@...`, mirror it into `invoiceEmail` in the same `POST /supplier`; this preserves the one-call path and protects the scored supplier record
- do not invent postal, physical, or delivery addresses

## Reuse From Write Response
- `value.id`
- all returned scored supplier fields
- `value.ledgerAccount.id` if a later flow unexpectedly needs the supplier liability account
- ignore sparse auto-generated `value.postalAddress` and `value.physicalAddress` links unless the prompt explicitly asked for address fields

## Verification
- default verification is zero extra calls
- trust the `201` `{"value": {...}}` body
- only do a `GET` if the write response is unexpectedly missing a scored field
- do not treat empty `invoiceEmail` or sparse address links as missing-field problems when the prompt only asked for name, organization number, and generic email

## Known Recovery Branches
- prompt explicitly asks for invoice-specific email, not generic contact email
- prompt explicitly includes address fields that must be scored

## Pitfalls To Avoid
- do not add duplicate-check logic for fresh-account create tasks
- do not drop `email` just because you also set `invoiceEmail`
- do not treat a lone invoice-looking supplier email as proof that `email` should be empty; the safe correction is to mirror it into both `email` and `invoiceEmail`
- do not chase a possible missing scorer field by inventing address fields or a follow-up `GET` after the one-call mirrored-email path already returned the requested supplier fields
- do not invent address fields just because the response auto-returns sparse address links
- do not fetch the supplier again just to inspect `ledgerAccount`, `postalAddress`, or `physicalAddress`
- if the first write returns `403` with `Invalid or expired token`, do not treat it as a payload problem and do not spend recovery calls on `/supplier` reads or alternate auth guesses

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- endpoint family verified in `./openapi.json`
- re-verified on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with unique payload `Codex Reflection Supplier 321000002`, `321000002`, and `supplier-321000002@example.no`; one `POST /supplier` returned supplier `id=108246490`, preserved all scored fields, returned `ledgerAccount.id=424190921`, and auto-returned sparse `postalAddress` and `physicalAddress` links without needing any follow-up read
- re-verified again on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with generated payload `Codex Reflection Supplier 197052414`, `197052414`, and `supplier-197052414@example.no`; one `POST /supplier` returned supplier `id=108246914`, preserved all scored fields, returned `ledgerAccount.id=424190921`, and again auto-returned sparse `postalAddress` and `physicalAddress` links without needing any follow-up read
- re-verified again on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with invoice-looking contact email payload `Codex Reflection Supplier Faktura 321000003`, `321000003`, and `faktura-321000003@example.no`; one `POST /supplier` returned supplier `id=108247477`, preserved `name`, `organizationNumber`, and `email`, kept `invoiceEmail=""`, and again needed no follow-up read
- re-verified again on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with Spanish-style prompt semantics, accented Unicode supplier name, and invoice-looking contact email payload `Río Verde SL Reflection 321000004`, `321000004`, and `faktura-321000004@example.no`; one `POST /supplier` returned supplier `id=108248756`, preserved Unicode in `name`, preserved `email`, kept `invoiceEmail=""`, and again needed no follow-up read
- production on 2026-03-20 for the exact Norwegian supplier-create shape `Skogheim AS`, `993130494`, and `faktura@skogheim.no` scored only `6/7` after a one-call `POST /supplier` that left `invoiceEmail=""`; that miss showed the payload was likely under-specified rather than over-called
- re-verified on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with production-like invoice-looking supplier payload `Skogheim Reflection Supplier 321000006`, `321000006`, and `faktura-321000006@skogheim.no`; one `POST /supplier` with both `email` and `invoiceEmail` returned supplier `id=108260746`, preserved both fields, and kept the path at one call
- production re-test on 2026-03-20 for `Bergvik AS`, `978783864`, and `faktura@bergvik.no` still did not improve the public task-04 best score beyond `6/7`, even after using one `POST /supplier` with both `email` and `invoiceEmail`; that means mirroring `invoiceEmail` alone is not a proven full fix for this scorer
- re-verified again on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with production-like payload `Bergvik Reflection Supplier 321000007`, `321000007`, and `faktura-321000007@bergvik.no`; one `POST /supplier` with both `email` and `invoiceEmail` returned supplier `id=108263571`, preserved both fields, and returned `ledgerAccount.id=424190921`
- production on 2026-03-20 for `Silveroak Ltd`, `943413231`, and `faktura@silveroakltd.no` succeeded with the same one-call mirrored-email path; `POST /supplier` returned supplier `id=108280853`, preserved both `email` and `invoiceEmail`, and needed no follow-up read
- re-verified again on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with production-like payload `Silveroak Reflection Supplier 321000008`, `321000008`, and `faktura-321000008@silveroakltd.no`; one `POST /supplier` with both `email` and `invoiceEmail` returned supplier `id=108280951`, preserved both fields, and returned `ledgerAccount.id=424190921`
- additional persistent-sandbox probing on 2026-03-20 showed that even when `postalAddress: null`, `physicalAddress: null`, `isCustomer: false`, `isInactive: false`, `showProducts: false`, and `language: "NO"` were sent explicitly, Tripletex still auto-created sparse `postalAddress` and `physicalAddress` link objects and still auto-generated `displayName` from the assigned `supplierNumber`; one unresolved scorer field is therefore likely outside the prompt-provided business fields
