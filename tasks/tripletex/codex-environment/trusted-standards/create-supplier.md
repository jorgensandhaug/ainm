# Create Supplier

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- create one new supplier
- prompt directly provides supplier identity fields
- no supplier invoice, payment, update, delete, or lookup-heavy workflow
- at most one generic email address

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- separate invoice email requested
- prompt requires postal, physical, or delivery address details
- foreign/company-setup edge case forces extra address or country fields
- task is update/delete/search-heavy

## Standard Flow
1. `POST /supplier`
2. verify directly from `response.value`
3. stop

## Exact-Match Fast Path
- for the plain supplier-create shape, the winning API path is exactly one write:
  - `POST /supplier`
- do not spend a pre-read on `/supplier`
- do not spend a follow-up read on `/supplier/{id}` when `response.value` already contains the scored fields
- do not spend scored-run time re-checking `./task-playbooks/create-supplier.md` or `./openapi.json` when this trusted standard already matches exactly

## Payload Rules
- send only prompt-required fields
- normal default shape:
  - `name`
  - `organizationNumber`
  - `email`
- preserve prompt text exactly, including Unicode
- map one generic prompt email to `email`
- a contact address that merely looks invoice-oriented, such as `faktura@...`, still maps to `email` unless the prompt explicitly asks for a separate invoice email
- do not invent `invoiceEmail`
- do not invent postal, physical, or delivery addresses

## Reuse From Write Response
- `value.id`
- all returned scored supplier fields
- `value.ledgerAccount.id` if a later flow unexpectedly needs the supplier liability account
- ignore sparse auto-generated `value.postalAddress` and `value.physicalAddress` links unless the prompt explicitly asked for address fields

## Verification
- default verification is zero extra calls
- trust the `201` `{"value": {...}}` body
- only do a `GET` if the write response is unexpectedly missing a scored field
- do not treat empty `invoiceEmail` or sparse address links as missing-field problems when the prompt only asked for name, organization number, and generic email

## Known Recovery Branches
- prompt explicitly asks for invoice-specific email, not generic contact email
- prompt explicitly includes address fields that must be scored

## Pitfalls To Avoid
- do not add duplicate-check logic for fresh-account create tasks
- do not map a generic `Email` label to `invoiceEmail`
- do not remap a lone `faktura@...` or other invoice-looking address to `invoiceEmail` unless the prompt explicitly labels it as a distinct invoice/billing email field
- do not invent address fields just because the response auto-returns sparse address links
- do not fetch the supplier again just to inspect `ledgerAccount`, `postalAddress`, or `physicalAddress`
- if the first write returns `403` with `Invalid or expired token`, do not treat it as a payload problem and do not spend recovery calls on `/supplier` reads or alternate auth guesses

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- endpoint family verified in `./openapi.json`
- re-verified on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with unique payload `Codex Reflection Supplier 321000002`, `321000002`, and `supplier-321000002@example.no`; one `POST /supplier` returned supplier `id=108246490`, preserved all scored fields, returned `ledgerAccount.id=424190921`, and auto-returned sparse `postalAddress` and `physicalAddress` links without needing any follow-up read
- re-verified again on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with generated payload `Codex Reflection Supplier 197052414`, `197052414`, and `supplier-197052414@example.no`; one `POST /supplier` returned supplier `id=108246914`, preserved all scored fields, returned `ledgerAccount.id=424190921`, and again auto-returned sparse `postalAddress` and `physicalAddress` links without needing any follow-up read
- re-verified again on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with invoice-looking contact email payload `Codex Reflection Supplier Faktura 321000003`, `321000003`, and `faktura-321000003@example.no`; one `POST /supplier` returned supplier `id=108247477`, preserved `name`, `organizationNumber`, and `email`, kept `invoiceEmail=""`, and again needed no follow-up read
