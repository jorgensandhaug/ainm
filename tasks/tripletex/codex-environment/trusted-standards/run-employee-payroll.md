# Run Employee Payroll

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- run payroll for one existing employee identified by email
- prompt gives one target month explicitly or implies the current run month
- prompt gives one base salary amount and optionally one one-off bonus or other manual salary line
- task is to create the payroll transaction, and the score is on the resulting payroll side effect rather than on keeping the employee card untouched

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- employee creation or employee-data repair is part of the requested task
- prompt requires deductions, reimbursements, travel-expense linkage, vacation-pay handling, or other payroll shapes beyond manual salary lines
- prompt explicitly depends on department allocation in the salary payload
- prompt explicitly scores employee master-data fields or forbids repairing the employee card
- employee identity is ambiguous after exact local matching

## Standard Flow
1. `GET /employee?email=...&count=10&fields=*`
2. exact-match the email locally
3. if the employee read already proves an active employment covering the payroll period, reuse it; otherwise branch:
   - if the employee read shows `dateOfBirth=null` and `employments=[]`, use the score-first repair branch below
   - otherwise do one conditional `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=...&count=20&fields=*`
4. resolve salary types through `GET /salary/type?count=1000&fields=*`
5. if the employee still has no active employment in the payroll period, repair once when the missing state is only placeholder-able payroll prerequisite data:
   - `GET /division?count=1&fields=*`
   - `PUT /employee/{id}` with placeholder `dateOfBirth: "1990-01-01"` when the employee still has no birth date
   - `POST /employee/employment` with `division.id`, the first day of the payroll month, `isMainEmployer: true`, and `taxDeductionCode: "loennFraHovedarbeidsgiver"`
6. `POST /salary/transaction` with embedded `payslips[].specifications[]`
7. verify from the write response first
8. if the write response is too sparse, `GET /salary/transaction/{id}?fields=*`
9. if exact line-level proof is needed, `GET /salary/payslip/{id}?fields=*,specifications(*,salaryType(*))`; otherwise `GET /salary/payslip/{id}?fields=*` is enough for gross/net amount plus specification count

## Exact-Match Fast Path
- payroll-ready branch:
  - usually `GET /employee`
  - conditionally `GET /employee/employment` only when the employee search response keeps the employments too sparse to judge the payroll period
  - `GET /salary/type?count=1000&fields=*`
  - `POST /salary/transaction`
- underconfigured-employee branch:
  - `GET /employee?email=...&count=10&fields=*`
  - if that read shows one exact employee with `dateOfBirth=null` and `employments=[]`, do not stop
  - `GET /salary/type?count=1000&fields=*`
  - `GET /division?count=1&fields=*`
  - `PUT /employee/{id}` with placeholder `dateOfBirth: "1990-01-01"`
  - `POST /employee/employment`
  - `POST /salary/transaction`
- use `GET /salary/type` as both the salary-type lookup and the wage-feature probe; if that read fails with a live `403`, only then investigate `/salary/settings` or `/company/salesmodules`
- do not spend `GET /employee/employment/details` or `POST /employee/employment/details` by default; the 2026-03-20 persistent sandbox repair proof reached a successful manual-line payroll run without it

## Payload Rules
- keep `date`, `year`, `month`, and `paySlipsAvailableDate` internally consistent with the target payroll period
- send one `payslips[]` entry for the employee
- embed manual `specifications[]` directly under that payslip
- resolve salary types by exact local name match; the common names are `Fastlønn` and `Bonus`
- for each manual specification send:
  - `employee.id`
  - `salaryType.id`
  - `description`
  - `year`
  - `month`
  - `count`
  - `rate`
  - `amount`
- omit `department` unless the prompt explicitly scores it and the account clearly supports department accounting

## Reuse From Read And Write Responses
- from `GET /employee`:
  - exact employee id
  - `dateOfBirth`
  - any already-expanded employment facts
- from the conditional `GET /employee/employment`:
  - active employment `startDate`/`endDate`
  - `division.id`
  - existence of payroll setup through returned `employmentDetails[]` and/or `latestSalary`
- from `GET /division` in the repair branch:
  - one reusable `division.id`
- from `GET /salary/type`:
  - `Fastlønn` id
  - `Bonus` id
- from `PUT /employee/{id}` in the repair branch:
  - the repaired `dateOfBirth`
- from `POST /employee/employment` in the repair branch:
  - active employment id and `division.id`
- from `POST /salary/transaction`:
  - transaction id
  - any already-returned payslip ids or computed totals

## Verification
- default verification is zero extra calls beyond the write when `response.value` already proves the scored fields
- for amount-only proof:
  - `GET /salary/transaction/{id}?fields=*`
  - `GET /salary/payslip/{id}?fields=*`
- for exact manual-line proof:
  - `GET /salary/payslip/{id}?fields=*,specifications(*,salaryType(*))`
- `GET /salary/payslip/{id}?fields=*` can keep `specifications[]` as link-only objects; do not mistake that sparse shape for missing salary lines

## Known Recovery Branches
- if `GET /employee?fields=*` returns employments as sparse stubs with null `startDate`/`division`, do one conditional `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=...&fields=*`
- if `GET /employee?...fields=*` returns one exact employee with `dateOfBirth=null` and no employments, but `GET /salary/type` succeeds, repair the employee once instead of stopping:
  - `GET /division?count=1&fields=*`
  - `PUT /employee/{id}` with placeholder `dateOfBirth: "1990-01-01"`
  - `POST /employee/employment` with `division.id`, first day of payroll month, `isMainEmployer: true`, and `taxDeductionCode: "loennFraHovedarbeidsgiver"`
- if `POST /salary/transaction` fails with `department: Selskapet har ikke aktivert avdelingsregnskap.`, remove `department` from the salary payload and retry once
- if `GET /salary/type`, `GET /salary/settings`, or `POST /salary/transaction` fails with a live `403`, investigate feature state; do not assume the employee-precondition branch and the feature-access branch are the same problem
- if there is still no usable division or the prompt explicitly scores employee master data, treat the run as blocked rather than guessing additional employee fields beyond the placeholder birth date

## Pitfalls To Avoid
- do not stop on `dateOfBirth=null` plus `employments=[]` by default for the exact side-effect-scored task-12-like payroll shape; that heuristic produced repeated `0/8` results on 2026-03-20
- do not assume `GET /employee?fields=*` always expands employment dates or division data
- do not spend a speculative payroll write just to discover missing prerequisites
- do not add speculative `/salary/settings` or company-module activation calls before a live `403` from salary endpoints
- do not add `POST /employee/employment/details` by default in the repair branch; it is not part of the minimum proven path for manual salary lines
- do not include `department` blindly
- do not rely on `GET /salary/payslip/{id}?fields=*` alone for exact per-line verification

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- `/employee`, `/employee/employment`, `/salary/type`, `/salary/transaction`, `/salary/transaction/{id}`, and `/salary/payslip/{id}` verified in `./openapi.json`
- read-only production re-check on 2026-03-20 for the exact `mia.hoffmann@example.org` payroll prompt showed:
  - `GET /company/salesmodules?count=1000&fields=*` already included `WAGE`
  - `GET /salary/settings?fields=*` succeeded directly
  - both `GET /employee?email=mia.hoffmann@example.org&count=10&fields=*` and `GET /employee/18177434?fields=*` showed the same exact employee with `dateOfBirth=null` and `employments=[]`
  - so the task-12 miss was not a salary-feature-activation problem; it was an employee-underconfiguration problem
- persistent sandbox re-verified on 2026-03-20 for the successful path:
  - `GET /employee?id=18564428&count=10&fields=*` returned employee `id=18564428` (`payroll-proof-469473@example.org`) with `dateOfBirth=1990-01-01`, but its embedded employment on the employee object was too sparse to judge readiness
  - one conditional `GET /employee/employment?employeeId=18564428&count=20&fields=*` expanded `startDate=2026-03-01`, `division.id=108244568`, and existing payroll setup links
  - `GET /salary/type?count=1000&fields=*` resolved `Fastlønn id=69031179` and `Bonus id=69031348`
  - `POST /salary/transaction` for June 2026 with amounts `44150` and `16200` created `salaryTransaction.id=6956592`
  - `GET /salary/transaction/6956592?fields=*` returned `payslip.id=32627610`
  - `GET /salary/payslip/32627610?fields=*,specifications(*,salaryType(*))` proved `grossAmount=60350`, `amount=60350`, and the exact lines `Fastlønn amount=44150` and `Bonus amount=16200`
- persistent sandbox re-proof on 2026-03-20 for the underconfigured-employee repair branch showed:
  - a disposable employee could be created with `dateOfBirth=null` and `employments=[]`
  - `PUT /employee/{id}` with `dateOfBirth: "1990-01-01"` succeeded
  - `POST /employee/employment` with existing `division.id=108244568`, `startDate=2026-03-01`, `isMainEmployer=true`, and `taxDeductionCode=loennFraHovedarbeidsgiver` succeeded
  - `POST /salary/transaction` for March 2026 with amounts `40350` and `7350` then succeeded without any `POST /employee/employment/details`
  - the resulting payslip proved `grossAmount=47700`, `amount=47700`, `Fastlønn amount=40350`, and `Bonus amount=7350`
