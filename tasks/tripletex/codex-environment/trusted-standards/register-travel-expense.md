# Register Travel Expense

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly only when the prompt gives enough travel-detail data to reach a deliverable final state
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- register one new travel expense for one existing employee identified by email
- prompt provides the travel title/purpose, cost lines, and one or more per-diem allowances
- prompt provides explicit `travelDetails.departureDate` and `travelDetails.returnDate`
- prompt also gives `travelDetails.departureFrom`, or the mandatory employee read is expected to expose one concrete non-generic location field, or one conditional company read via `employee.companyId` is expected to expose one concrete non-generic company-address field that can be reused as `departureFrom`
- if per diem spans overnight, the prompt also gives enough information to choose one overnight-accommodation branch, or a pre-approved deterministic inference exists
- no attachment, approval, mileage, accommodation allowance, project linking, update, or delete flow

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- task needs mileage allowance, accommodation allowance, or attachments
- prompt gives only trip duration and not explicit travel dates
- prompt omits `travelDetails.departureFrom` and neither the employee read nor one conditional company read via `employee.companyId` is likely to provide a concrete location
- prompt needs overnight per diem but does not give enough information to choose an accommodation branch safely
- employee identity is ambiguous or the employee must be created first
- prompt is not a create-only travel-expense registration task

## Standard Flow
1. `GET /employee?email=...&count=10&fields=*`
2. If the prompt omits `departureFrom` and the employee read has no concrete address field but does expose `companyId`, `GET /company/{companyId}?fields=*,address(*)`
3. `GET /travelExpense/costCategory?count=1000&fields=*`
4. `GET /travelExpense/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*`
5. `GET /travelExpense/rate?type=PER_DIEM&isValidDomestic=true&dateFrom=...&dateTo=...&count=1000&fields=*` when the prompt includes domestic per diem
6. `POST /travelExpense` with embedded `costs[]` and `perDiemCompensations[]`
7. `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver?id=...`
8. verify the delivered parent fields and child id counts from the deliver response
9. stop

## Payload Rules
- resolve one exact employee by exact email match; prefer `allowInformationRegistration=true` when multiple exact-email matches exist
- filter cost categories locally on `showOnTravelExpenses=true`
- prefer exact category-description matches for prompt costs such as `Fly` and `Taxi`
- resolve one active travel payment type from `showOnTravelExpenses=true`; in sandbox the ordinary reimbursement type was `Privat utlegg`
- do not send `department` on a normal existing-employee travel expense unless the prompt explicitly scores a different department or live validation requires it
- include `travelDetails.departureFrom`; leaving it empty can still let `POST /travelExpense` succeed but later block `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver`
- if the prompt omits `departureFrom`, first infer it from one concrete employee address field already returned by `GET /employee`, preferring `address.city`, then `address.addressLine1`, then `address.displayName`
- if those employee address fields are absent but the same employee object exposes `companyId`, do one conditional `GET /company/{companyId}?fields=*,address(*)` and infer `departureFrom` from `company.address.city`, then `company.address.addressLine1`, then `company.address.displayName`, then `company.address.addressAsString`
- `GET /company/{companyId}?fields=*` alone is not sufficient for this branch; in sandbox it left `company.address` as a link object
- if both employee and company address fields are absent, treat the run as blocked instead of inventing generic placeholders such as `Hjemsted`
- when any per diem compensation is present, set `travelDetails.isCompensationFromRates=true`
- for multi-day or overnight per diem, resolve one compatible `perDiemCompensations[].rateType` from `/travelExpense/rate`; do not leave `rateType`/`rateCategory` null
- the filtered `/travelExpense/rate?...fields=*` response can still return `rateCategory` only as `id`/`url`; do not locally require `rateCategory.isValidDomestic` or `isRequiresOvernightAccommodation` after the query already filtered the set
- prefer a returned `rateType` whose numeric `rate` matches the prompt day rate when such a row exists; otherwise reuse any returned `rateType.id` and preserve the prompt-scored manual `count`/`rate`/`amount`
- for overnight per diem, set `perDiemCompensations[].overnightAccommodation`; in sandbox the generic deliverable branch accepted `HOTEL`
- embed `perDiemCompensations[]` directly on the `POST /travelExpense` payload
- embed `costs[]` directly on the same `POST /travelExpense` payload
- for each embedded cost in NOK, send both `amountCurrencyIncVat` and `amountNOKInclVAT`
- do not rely on the category default VAT when the expense must be deliverable; in sandbox, explicit `costs[].vatType={ "id": 0 }` avoided later non-VAT-company delivery failure
- preserve prompt text exactly in `title`, `travelDetails.purpose`, `travelDetails.detailedJourneyDescription`, and `costs[].comments`
- do not encode a trusted default date inference for duration-only prompts; sandbox accepted several different delivered date ranges for the same Bergen probe, so omitted dates are not an exact-match trusted-standard case
- if a scored run still forces action on a duration-only prompt, keep that branch outside the trusted standard: choose one deterministic local date range and continue with the normal employee/company/rate/create/deliver flow rather than spending extra Tripletex reads, because the API does not reveal a unique scorer-correct range

## Reuse From Write Response
- `travelExpense.id`
- top-level `title`
- linked `employee.id`
- `travelDetails` fields
- returned `department.id` if Tripletex inherits it from the employee
- embedded child ids and child counts, but expect them to be sparse

## Verification
- do not treat the `POST /travelExpense` response alone as proof of full correctness for multi-day per-diem tasks; it can return an `OPEN` expense whose per-diem row is not deliverable
- verify the final top-level travel-expense fields from `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver`; the operation returns `ListResponseTravelExpense`, so read the delivered object from `values[]`
- for exact scored runs, do not add `/travelExpense/cost` or `/travelExpense/perDiemCompensation` follow-up reads just to reassure yourself unless the deliver response contradicts the intended child counts
- do not rely on `GET /travelExpense/{id}?fields=*` for expanded child details; `costs[]` and `perDiemCompensations[]` can still be link-only `id`/`url`
- do not use top-level `amount` or `paymentAmount` as proof of per-diem correctness; in sandbox those totals still reflected only embedded cost reimbursement even after successful delivery
- only use `GET /travelExpense/cost?travelExpenseId=...&fields=*` and `GET /travelExpense/perDiemCompensation?travelExpenseId=...&fields=*` as a conditional investigation branch when:
  - the prompt materially differs from the embedded-create standard
  - a later step truly needs expanded child fields
  - the live write response contradicts the intended child counts

## Known Recovery Branches
- if `POST /travelExpense` fails on `costs.amountCurrencyIncVat`, add `amountCurrencyIncVat` on every embedded cost row
- if `POST /travelExpense` fails with `Kun kostnader kan registreres uten kompensasjon etter satser.`, set `travelDetails.isCompensationFromRates=true`
- if `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` fails on `travelDetails.departureFrom`, the create-only path was incomplete; do not keep treating the `OPEN` expense as final
- if `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` fails on `perDiemCompensations.rateType.id`, resolve a compatible live `rateType` from `/travelExpense/rate` and recreate with that field populated
- if `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` fails on `costs.vatType.id` because the company is not VAT registered, recreate with explicit zero-VAT cost rows rather than trusting the category default VAT

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- `/travelExpense`, `/travelExpense/:deliver`, `/travelExpense/cost`, `/travelExpense/perDiemCompensation`, `/travelExpense/costCategory`, `/travelExpense/paymentType`, and `/travelExpense/rate` verified in `./openapi.json`
- persistent sandbox re-verified on 2026-03-20:
  - `GET /company/{companyId}?fields=*,address(*)` expanded the company postal address, while `fields=*` alone left `company.address` as a link-only object
  - a no-address employee (`id=18478235`, `address=null`, `companyId=108114337`) plus that one company read produced concrete `departureFrom="Oslo"` from `company.address.city`
  - the 7-call branch `GET /employee` -> `GET /company/{companyId}?fields=*,address(*)` -> `GET /travelExpense/costCategory` -> `GET /travelExpense/paymentType` -> `GET /travelExpense/rate` -> `POST /travelExpense` -> `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` delivered sandbox travel expense `11145429` with `state=DELIVERED`, `costs.length=2`, and `perDiemCompensations.length=1`
  - `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` returned `ListResponseTravelExpense` with the delivered parent row under `values[]`, not `ResponseWrapperTravelExpense`
  - `GET /travelExpense/rate?type=PER_DIEM&isValidDomestic=true&dateFrom=...&dateTo=...&count=1000&fields=*` returned five usable `rateType` rows, but each `rateCategory` came back only as sparse `id`/`url`
  - using one of those returned sparse `rateType.id` values still allowed a delivered manual per-diem row to persist the prompt-scored `count`, `rate`, and `amount`
  - one `POST /travelExpense` with only manual per-diem `count`/`rate`/`amount` created the parent expense plus embedded rows, but left the expense in `state=OPEN`
  - that create-only branch also persisted `perDiemCompensations[].rateType=null`, `rateCategory=null`, and `overnightAccommodation=NONE`
  - `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` then failed until `travelDetails.departureFrom`, a compatible per-diem `rateType`, and delivery-safe cost `vatType` values were present
  - recreating with explicit `departureFrom`, `perDiemCompensations[].rateType`, `perDiemCompensations[].overnightAccommodation`, and zero-VAT cost rows allowed `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` to succeed and move the expense to `state=DELIVERED`
  - ambiguity probe script `sandbox_travel_expense_ambiguity_probe.ts` then created three delivered Bergen expenses with the same employee, cost rows, and per-diem row but different inferred values:
    - `11145899`: `departureDate=2026-03-17`, `returnDate=2026-03-20`, `departureFrom=Oslo`
    - `11145900`: `departureDate=2026-03-16`, `returnDate=2026-03-19`, `departureFrom=Oslo`
    - `11145901`: `departureDate=2026-03-17`, `returnDate=2026-03-20`, `departureFrom=Drammen`
  - Tripletex accepted all three as `state=DELIVERED`, so the API does not supply a trusted unique inference for duration-only + omitted-`departureFrom` prompts
  - same-day Bodø re-proof `sandbox_verify_duration_only_travel_expense.ts` used the known no-address employee `18478235` plus company-city fallback `Oslo` and still delivered two otherwise-identical `3 x 800` / `6200 + 400` expenses with different date ranges:
    - `11146082`: `departureDate=2026-03-18`, `returnDate=2026-03-20`, `departureFrom=Oslo`
    - `11146083`: `departureDate=2026-03-17`, `returnDate=2026-03-19`, `departureFrom=Oslo`
  - that 3-day Bodø re-proof confirms the ambiguity is not limited to the older 4-day Bergen probe; even after company fallback is fixed, the API still accepts multiple delivered date ranges for the same prompt family
  - the 2026-03-20 production run for Torbjorn Brekke likely lost correctness by inventing `departureFrom=\"Hjemsted\"` after the prompt omitted departureFrom and the employee read did not provide a concrete location; generic placeholders are not a trusted correctness path
  - the 2026-03-20 production run for `Miguel Pérez` / `miguel.perez@example.org` wasted two extra employee reads before switching to the proven company-address branch; the lower-call replacement for that exact prompt shape is to add the company read immediately after the first employee read returns `address=null`
  - `PUT /travelExpense/:approve` returned `403` for the sandbox token; approval is not a trusted default follow-up step
  - sandbox re-verified on 2026-03-21: `costCategory` and `paymentType` with `id=0` succeed at `POST /travelExpense` but fail at `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` with `422`; real lookup IDs are required for delivery
  - sandbox re-verified on 2026-03-21: `perDiemCompensations` without `rateType` also succeed at `POST` but fail at `PUT :deliver` with `422 Sats eller satskategori må spesifiseres`; the rate lookup cannot be skipped
- production confirmed on 2026-03-21:
  - `Pablo Rodríguez` / `pablo.rodriguez@example.org` / `Conferencia Ålesund` / 5-day per-diem (800/day) + flight 2750 + taxi 700
  - duration-only prompt (no explicit dates), employee had `address=null`, company-address fallback produced `departureFrom=Oslo`
  - the forced-action branch with deterministic dates `2026-03-17..2026-03-21` produced a clean 7-call run: employee → company → costCategory + paymentType + rate (parallel) → POST → PUT :deliver
  - 0 errors, `state=DELIVERED`, travel expense `11149202`, `costs.length=2`, `perDiemCompensations.length=1`
  - no `rateType.rate` matched the prompt day rate of `800`, so the first returned `rateType.id=25886` (rate `397`) was used; `PUT :deliver` still accepted the manual per-diem `count=5, rate=800, amount=4000`
