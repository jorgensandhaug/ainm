# Register Travel Expense

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly only when the prompt gives enough travel-detail data to reach a deliverable final state
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- register one new travel expense for one existing employee identified by email
- prompt provides the travel title/purpose, cost lines, and one or more per-diem allowances
- prompt also gives `travelDetails.departureFrom`, or the mandatory employee read is expected to expose one concrete non-generic location field that can be reused as `departureFrom`
- if per diem spans overnight, the prompt also gives enough information to choose one overnight-accommodation branch, or a pre-approved deterministic inference exists
- no attachment, approval, mileage, accommodation allowance, project linking, update, or delete flow

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- task needs mileage allowance, accommodation allowance, or attachments
- prompt omits `travelDetails.departureFrom` and the employee read is unlikely to provide a concrete location
- prompt needs overnight per diem but does not give enough information to choose an accommodation branch safely
- employee identity is ambiguous or the employee must be created first
- prompt is not a create-only travel-expense registration task

## Standard Flow
1. `GET /employee?email=...&count=10&fields=*`
2. `GET /travelExpense/costCategory?count=1000&fields=*`
3. `GET /travelExpense/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*`
4. `GET /travelExpense/rate?type=PER_DIEM&isValidDomestic=true&dateFrom=...&dateTo=...&count=1000&fields=*` when the prompt includes domestic per diem
5. `POST /travelExpense` with embedded `costs[]` and `perDiemCompensations[]`
6. `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver?id=...`
7. verify the delivered parent fields and child id counts from the deliver response
8. stop

## Payload Rules
- resolve one exact employee by exact email match; prefer `allowInformationRegistration=true` when multiple exact-email matches exist
- filter cost categories locally on `showOnTravelExpenses=true`
- prefer exact category-description matches for prompt costs such as `Fly` and `Taxi`
- resolve one active travel payment type from `showOnTravelExpenses=true`; in sandbox the ordinary reimbursement type was `Privat utlegg`
- do not send `department` on a normal existing-employee travel expense unless the prompt explicitly scores a different department or live validation requires it
- include `travelDetails.departureFrom`; leaving it empty can still let `POST /travelExpense` succeed but later block `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver`
- if the prompt omits `departureFrom`, only infer it from one concrete employee address field already returned by `GET /employee`, preferring `address.city`, then `address.addressLine1`, then `address.displayName`; do not invent generic placeholders such as `Hjemsted`
- when any per diem compensation is present, set `travelDetails.isCompensationFromRates=true`
- for multi-day or overnight per diem, resolve one compatible `perDiemCompensations[].rateType` from `/travelExpense/rate`; do not leave `rateType`/`rateCategory` null
- the filtered `/travelExpense/rate?...fields=*` response can still return `rateCategory` only as `id`/`url`; do not locally require `rateCategory.isValidDomestic` or `isRequiresOvernightAccommodation` after the query already filtered the set
- prefer a returned `rateType` whose numeric `rate` matches the prompt day rate when such a row exists; otherwise reuse any returned `rateType.id` and preserve the prompt-scored manual `count`/`rate`/`amount`
- for overnight per diem, set `perDiemCompensations[].overnightAccommodation`; in sandbox the generic deliverable branch accepted `HOTEL`
- embed `perDiemCompensations[]` directly on the `POST /travelExpense` payload
- embed `costs[]` directly on the same `POST /travelExpense` payload
- for each embedded cost in NOK, send both `amountCurrencyIncVat` and `amountNOKInclVAT`
- do not rely on the category default VAT when the expense must be deliverable; in sandbox, explicit `costs[].vatType={ "id": 0 }` avoided later non-VAT-company delivery failure
- preserve prompt text exactly in `title`, `travelDetails.purpose`, `travelDetails.detailedJourneyDescription`, and `costs[].comments`
- if the prompt gives only trip duration and no explicit dates, use one deterministic inferred range rather than spending extra API calls; the default fallback is an inclusive range ending on the run date

## Reuse From Write Response
- `travelExpense.id`
- top-level `title`
- linked `employee.id`
- `travelDetails` fields
- returned `department.id` if Tripletex inherits it from the employee
- embedded child ids and child counts, but expect them to be sparse

## Verification
- do not treat the `POST /travelExpense` response alone as proof of full correctness for multi-day per-diem tasks; it can return an `OPEN` expense whose per-diem row is not deliverable
- verify the final top-level travel-expense fields from the `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` response
- for exact scored runs, do not add `/travelExpense/cost` or `/travelExpense/perDiemCompensation` follow-up reads just to reassure yourself unless the deliver response contradicts the intended child counts
- do not rely on `GET /travelExpense/{id}?fields=*` for expanded child details; `costs[]` and `perDiemCompensations[]` can still be link-only `id`/`url`
- do not use top-level `amount` or `paymentAmount` as proof of per-diem correctness; in sandbox those totals still reflected only embedded cost reimbursement even after successful delivery
- only use `GET /travelExpense/cost?travelExpenseId=...&fields=*` and `GET /travelExpense/perDiemCompensation?travelExpenseId=...&fields=*` as a conditional investigation branch when:
  - the prompt materially differs from the embedded-create standard
  - a later step truly needs expanded child fields
  - the live write response contradicts the intended child counts

## Known Recovery Branches
- if `POST /travelExpense` fails on `costs.amountCurrencyIncVat`, add `amountCurrencyIncVat` on every embedded cost row
- if `POST /travelExpense` fails with `Kun kostnader kan registreres uten kompensasjon etter satser.`, set `travelDetails.isCompensationFromRates=true`
- if `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` fails on `travelDetails.departureFrom`, the create-only path was incomplete; do not keep treating the `OPEN` expense as final
- if `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` fails on `perDiemCompensations.rateType.id`, resolve a compatible live `rateType` from `/travelExpense/rate` and recreate with that field populated
- if `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` fails on `costs.vatType.id` because the company is not VAT registered, recreate with explicit zero-VAT cost rows rather than trusting the category default VAT

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- `/travelExpense`, `/travelExpense/:deliver`, `/travelExpense/cost`, `/travelExpense/perDiemCompensation`, `/travelExpense/costCategory`, `/travelExpense/paymentType`, and `/travelExpense/rate` verified in `./openapi.json`
- persistent sandbox re-verified on 2026-03-20:
  - `GET /travelExpense/rate?type=PER_DIEM&isValidDomestic=true&dateFrom=...&dateTo=...&count=1000&fields=*` returned five usable `rateType` rows, but each `rateCategory` came back only as sparse `id`/`url`
  - using one of those returned sparse `rateType.id` values still allowed a delivered manual per-diem row to persist the prompt-scored `count`, `rate`, and `amount`
  - one `POST /travelExpense` with only manual per-diem `count`/`rate`/`amount` created the parent expense plus embedded rows, but left the expense in `state=OPEN`
  - that create-only branch also persisted `perDiemCompensations[].rateType=null`, `rateCategory=null`, and `overnightAccommodation=NONE`
  - `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` then failed until `travelDetails.departureFrom`, a compatible per-diem `rateType`, and delivery-safe cost `vatType` values were present
  - recreating with explicit `departureFrom`, `perDiemCompensations[].rateType`, `perDiemCompensations[].overnightAccommodation`, and zero-VAT cost rows allowed `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` to succeed and move the expense to `state=DELIVERED`
  - the 2026-03-20 production run for Torbjorn Brekke likely lost correctness by inventing `departureFrom=\"Hjemsted\"` after the prompt omitted departureFrom and the employee read did not provide a concrete location; generic placeholders are not a trusted correctness path
  - `PUT /travelExpense/:approve` returned `403` for the sandbox token; approval is not a trusted default follow-up step
