# Register Project Hours and Create Project Invoice

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- register hours on an existing employee, project, and activity
- prompt gives the hour count and hourly rate directly
- create an unsent project invoice to the linked customer
- project, customer, employee, and activity already exist

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- the prompt explicitly scores true public-API hour-consumption semantics such as the time entry becoming invoiced or the project hour reserve being consumed by the created invoice
- the resolved project activity is non-chargeable and the task cannot be satisfied with the public fallback invoice path
- the task also requires creating the employee, customer, or project first

## Standard Flow
1. `GET /employee?email=...&count=10&fields=*`
2. `GET /customer?organizationNumber=...&count=10&fields=*`
3. `GET /project?name=...&customerId=...&count=50&fields=*`
4. `GET /activity/>forTimeSheet?projectId=...&employeeId=...&date=...&query=...&filterExistingHours=false&count=50&fields=*`
5. if the resolved activity is not chargeable:
   - treat the true hour-linked invoice path as blocked through the documented public API
   - do not try to attach a project-specific rate to that activity
6. `GET /project/hourlyRates?projectId=...&count=100&fields=*`
7. if needed, `PUT /project/hourlyRates/{id}` with:
   - `project`
   - `startDate`
   - `hourlyRateModel: "TYPE_PROJECT_SPECIFIC_HOURLY_RATES"`
8. `POST /project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates` for the exact employee + activity + hourly rate
9. `POST /timesheet/entry`
10. `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=...&fields=*`
11. `POST /order` with:
   - `customer`
   - `project`
   - `orderDate`
   - `deliveryDate`
   - one real embedded `orderLines[]` entry using the prompt hours and prompt rate
12. `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?invoiceDate=...&sendToCustomer=false`

## Payload Rules
- use `projectChargeableHours` on the timesheet write when the project hours are meant to be billable
- do not try to send `projectSpecificRates[]` embedded inside the `PUT /project/hourlyRates/{id}` payload as the only rate write; the model switch and the project-specific-rate create are separate writes
- the real invoice line should usually use:
  - `description` from the prompt activity or prompt billing text
  - `count` equal to the prompt hours
  - `unitPriceExcludingVatCurrency` equal to the prompt rate
  - `vatType` from the filtered outgoing VAT lookup
- do not insert a default `PUT /timesheet/week/:approve`; it can return `403` even for the token owner and is not part of the proven public fast path

## Reuse From Write Response
- from `PUT /project/hourlyRates/{id}`:
  - the switched project-hourly-rate holder id
- from `POST /project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates`:
  - the created project-specific-rate id
- from `POST /timesheet/entry`:
  - the created entry id
  - `hourlyRate`
  - `chargeable`
- from `POST /order`:
  - the created order id
- from `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice`:
  - invoice id
  - invoice number
  - totals and outstanding amount

## Verification
- trust the timesheet write response to verify:
  - `hours`
  - `projectChargeableHours`
  - `hourlyRate`
  - `chargeable`
- trust the invoice write response to verify:
  - `customer.id`
  - `orders[0].id`
  - `amountExcludingVatCurrency`
  - `amountCurrencyOutstanding`
- add a follow-up `GET /invoice/{id}?fields=*,orders(*,project(*),orderLines(*)),orderLines(*)` only if the invoice write response is too sparse for the scored fields

## Known Recovery Branches
- if the activity returned by `/activity/>forTimeSheet` is non-chargeable:
  - `POST /project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates` on that activity is expected to fail with `422 activity.id: Ikke fakturerbar.`
  - a time entry on that activity can still be created, but it will keep `chargeable=false` and `hourlyRate=0`
  - treat the exact hour-linked invoice request as blocked by public API capability rather than burning more write attempts
- if `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice` fails only with `Faktura kan ikke opprettes før selskapet har registrert et bankkontonummer.`:
  - `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*`
  - update the existing invoice bank account with `PUT /ledger/account/{id}` and a valid unique `bankAccountNumber`
  - retry the same `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?...` once
- if `POST /order` echoes `orderLines=[]`, do not assume the embedded line failed; rely on the later invoice response first

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- `/activity/>forTimeSheet`, `/project/hourlyRates`, `/project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates`, `/timesheet/entry`, `/ledger/vatType`, `/order`, and `/order/{id}/:invoice` re-verified on 2026-03-20
- persistent sandbox proved:
  - `PUT /project/hourlyRates/{id}` can switch the holder to `TYPE_PROJECT_SPECIFIC_HOURLY_RATES`
  - `POST /project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates` succeeds for a chargeable activity and then `POST /timesheet/entry` returns `hourlyRate=<prompt rate>`
  - `POST /project/hourlyRates/projectSpecificRates` fails with `422 activity.id: Ikke fakturerbar.` on a non-chargeable activity
  - `POST /order` or `POST /invoice` with a project but no real order lines does not produce a chargeable project-hours invoice through the public API
  - the proven public fallback for the invoice side effect is one real project-linked order line derived from prompt hours and prompt rate, followed by normal order invoicing
