# Create Customer Invoice Credit Note

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- create one full credit note that nullifies one existing outgoing customer invoice
- prompt identifies the invoice strongly enough to find it in one decisive read
- task is a full reversal, not a partial credit or manual ledger correction
- task does not require sending the credit note

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- task is a partial credit-note flow
- prompt already gives the exact invoice id and the one-write path is available
- prompt is too ambiguous to identify one invoice safely
- task is actually payment reversal rather than invoice crediting
- task explicitly requires sending the credit note

## Standard Flow
1. `GET /invoice?...&fields=*,customer(*),orderLines(*),orders(*,orderLines(*))` to identify the exact original invoice
2. `PUT /invoice/{id}/:createCreditNote?date=<date>&sendToCustomer=false`
3. verify from the credit-note write response
4. stop

## Exact-Match Fast Path
- if the prompt gives:
  - customer organization number
  - exact ex-VAT amount
  - exact service or line description
  - no exact invoice id
- the minimal realistic path is exactly two API calls:
  1. one decisive `GET /invoice?...`
  2. one `PUT /invoice/{id}/:createCreditNote?...`
- only reduce this to one API call when the prompt already gives the exact invoice id
- do not spend a separate `GET /customer` or `GET /invoice/{id}` in the standard shape
- for the exact prompt shapes `organizationNumber=900993560`, `description="Maintenance"`, `amountExcludingVatCurrency=30500`, `organizationNumber=812449982`, `description="Datarådgjeving"`, `amountExcludingVatCurrency=45300`, `organizationNumber=973999966`, `description="Conseil en données"`, `amountExcludingVatCurrency=40800`, `organizationNumber=882988155`, `description="Heures de conseil"`, `amountExcludingVatCurrency=40900`, `organizationNumber=991882502`, `description="Opplæring"`, `amountExcludingVatCurrency=13100`, `organizationNumber=962075754`, `description="Analysebericht"`, `amountExcludingVatCurrency=30200`, that two-call path was the successful production path on 2026-03-20
- for the exact prompt shape `organizationNumber=996887898`, `description="Vedlikehold"`, `amountExcludingVatCurrency=19200`, that two-call path was the successful production path on 2026-03-21

## Payload Rules
- locate the invoice by prompt facts such as:
  - `customer.organizationNumber`
  - exact ex-VAT amount
  - exact service/line description
- check both `orderLines[].description` and `orders[].orderLines[].description`
- if the same exact description appears in both places on one invoice, treat that as one invoice match, not as ambiguity
- if the prompt gives no invoice date, prefer one wide but bounded invoice search window such as:
  - `invoiceDateFrom=2000-01-01`
  - `invoiceDateTo=<run-date-plus-one-day>`
- filter out:
  - `isCreditNote=true`
  - `isCredited=true`
- for the create-credit-note write:
  - always send `date`
  - default to `sendToCustomer=false` unless the prompt explicitly requires sending
- do not create a manual negative invoice
- do not reverse a voucher unless the task is explicitly about payment reversal

## Reuse From Write Response
- credit note id from `value.id`
- credit note number from `value.invoiceNumber`
- original invoice linkage from `value.creditedInvoice`
- `value.isCreditNote`

## Verification
- default verification is zero extra calls after the credit-note write
- trust the write response when it proves:
  - `isCreditNote=true`
  - `creditedInvoice=<original invoice id>`

## Known Recovery Branches
- if the invoice locate step is ambiguous, add one extra targeted resolver such as `GET /customer?organizationNumber=...&fields=*`
- if the prompt already gives the exact invoice id, skip the locate read and go straight to `PUT /invoice/{id}/:createCreditNote`

- re-verified on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox:
  - a fresh fixture customer plus invoice could still be credited through the same standard two-call core of:
    - `GET /invoice?invoiceDateFrom=2026-01-01&invoiceDateTo=2027-01-01&count=1000&sorting=-invoiceDate&fields=*,customer(*),orderLines(*),orders(*,orderLines(*))`
    - `PUT /invoice/{id}/:createCreditNote?date=2026-03-20&sendToCustomer=false`
  - the locate step matched the created fixture invoice exactly by organization number, `amountExcludingVatCurrency=10400`, and nested order-line description
  - the write response returned a distinct credit note with `isCreditNote=true` and `creditedInvoice=<original id>`
  - one decisive `GET /invoice?invoiceDateFrom=2026-01-01&invoiceDateTo=2027-01-01&count=1000&sorting=-invoiceDate&fields=*,customer(*),orderLines(*),orders(*,orderLines(*))` uniquely located the target invoice by organization number, exact ex-VAT amount, and exact line description
  - `PUT /invoice/{id}/:createCreditNote?date=2026-03-20&sendToCustomer=false` returned the created credit note with `isCreditNote=true` and `creditedInvoice=<original id>`
  - re-verified again on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with a disposable invoice matching the production-style facts `description="Datarådgjeving"` and `amountExcludingVatCurrency=45300`; the locate read produced two identical description hits across top-level `orderLines[]` and nested `orders[].orderLines[]`, but still uniquely identified one invoice by organization number + amount + invoice-level uniqueness
  - re-verified again on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with a disposable invoice matching the production-style facts `description="Maintenance"` and `amountExcludingVatCurrency=45550`; the locate read returned the same description under both top-level `orderLines[]` and nested `orders[].orderLines[]`, but still uniquely identified one invoice by organization number + amount + invoice-level uniqueness
  - re-verified again on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with a disposable invoice matching the exact prompt identifiers `organizationNumber=900993560`, `description="Maintenance"`, `amountExcludingVatCurrency=30500`; the same two-call core located the created invoice and the credit-note write response alone proved success with `isCreditNote=true` and `creditedInvoice=<original id>`

  - on that exact-identifier French fixture, `PUT /invoice/{id}/:createCreditNote?date=2026-03-20&sendToCustomer=false` returned the created credit note with `isCreditNote=true` and `creditedInvoice=<original id>` and needed no follow-up read

  - on that `Heures de conseil` analog, the same exact description appeared under both top-level `orderLines[]` and nested `orders[].orderLines[]` on the same invoice, and `PUT /invoice/{id}/:createCreditNote?date=2026-03-20&sendToCustomer=false` still returned `isCreditNote=true` with `creditedInvoice=<original id>` and no follow-up read
