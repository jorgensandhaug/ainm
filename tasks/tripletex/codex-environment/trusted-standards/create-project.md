# Create Project

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- create one project
- prompt provides project name and basic fields directly
- any required customer or project manager is already clearly known or resolvable in one read each
- prompt may omit `startDate`
- no invoicing in the same task

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- fixed-price billing/invoice workflow is part of the task
- the prompt is really a multi-project ledger-analysis task; use the dedicated internal-project batch standard instead
- project manager eligibility is unclear
- the prompt requires a newly created employee to become project manager and no prior corpus evidence proves that access path in the current task family
- task is update/delete/search-heavy

## Standard Flow
1. resolve customer if needed with one decisive `GET /customer?organizationNumber=...&count=10&fields=*`
2. resolve project manager only if needed with one decisive `GET /employee?email=...&assignableProjectManagers=true&count=10&fields=*`
3. `POST /project`
4. verify directly from write response
5. stop

## Keep It Minimal
- for an exact match, do not re-check `./openapi.json` before the first call
- do not add `GET /project`, `GET /customer/{id}`, or `GET /employee/{id}` verification reads unless the write response unexpectedly omits a scored field
- there is still no safe `2`-call shortcut for the exact `existing customer by organizationNumber + existing manager by email` shape
- do not try to skip the customer read by sending nested `customer { name, organizationNumber }` on `POST /project`; persistent sandbox on `2026-03-20` returned `201` but left `value.customer == null`
- do not try to skip the manager read by sending project-manager details without `id`; persistent sandbox on `2026-03-20` still validated that branch as missing/invalid project manager data

## Payload Rules
- usually include:
  - `name`
  - `startDate`
  - `customer: { "id": ... }` if customer is part of task
  - `projectManager: { "id": ... }` if manager is part of task
- always include `startDate`
- if the prompt omits `startDate` for a create-only project task, default it to the run date in ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`
- prefer assignable project managers, not any arbitrary employee
- do not assume a newly created employee is automatically assignable as project manager; persistent sandbox follow-up on `2026-03-21` rejected that branch even after the employee create itself had succeeded
- do not assume `isInternal=true` makes `projectManager` optional; the dedicated 2026-03-21 internal-project proof still returned `422 Feltet "Prosjektleder" må fylles ut.` without a manager
- keep uniqueness checks local:
  - compare returned `customer.organizationNumber` exactly, and use prompt `customer.name` only as a local tie-breaker when present
  - compare returned `employee.email` exactly because the endpoint filter is containing, and use prompt manager name only as a local tie-breaker when present
  - if the filtered read already yields exactly one exact-`organizationNumber` hit or one exact-`email` hit, do not require the prompt name to match before reusing that id

## Reuse From Write Response
- `value.id`
- `value.customer.id`
- `value.projectManager.id`
- fixed-price fields if present

## Verification
- default verification is zero extra calls
- trust the write response if it already proves `name`, `startDate`, `customer.id`, and `projectManager.id`

## Known Recovery Branches
- if project-manager assignment is validated strictly, resolve with `assignableProjectManagers=true`
- if a newly created employee still fails the project-manager access validation, do not guess a hidden access-toggle endpoint; this task family is outside the exact trusted standard until corpus evidence proves the public repair path

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- `/project` verified in `./openapi.json`
- required `startDate` and manager-eligibility gotchas proven in existing playbooks
- sandbox create on `2026-03-20` succeeded with omitted-prompt `startDate` mapped to the run date
- persistent sandbox re-proof on `2026-03-20` confirmed the exact `3`-call path remains minimal: one exact customer read, one assignable-manager read, one project write
- that same re-proof also showed the tempting nested-customer shortcut is dangerous because `POST /project` can succeed while silently dropping the customer link
- production create on `2026-03-20` for customer `986713344` plus manager `bruno.pereira@example.org` also succeeded with the exact 3-call path and no follow-up reads
- production create on `2026-03-20` for project `Análise Porto` / customer `Porto Alegre Lda` (`996943305`) plus `lucas.oliveira@example.org` also succeeded with the same exact `3`-call path and no follow-up reads; the Unicode `á` in the project name was not a reason to add any extra resolver or verification read
- production create on `2026-03-20` for `Porto Alegre Lda` / `884811686` plus `lucas.silva@example.org` also succeeded with the same exact `3`-call path and no follow-up reads
- production create on `2026-03-20` for `Havbris AS` / `999148387` plus `henrik.degard@example.org` also succeeded with the same exact `3`-call path and no follow-up reads; the prompt manager name used `Ø` while the email local-part used ASCII `degard`, and that was not a reason to add disambiguation calls once the filtered employee read left one exact email hit
- production create on `2026-03-21` for `Implémentation Montagne` / `Montagne SARL` / `842138248` plus `jules.martin@example.org` also succeeded with the same exact `3`-call path and no follow-up reads; the Unicode `é` in the project name was not a reason to add any extra read
- persistent sandbox re-proof on `2026-03-21` re-confirmed that nested customer `{ name, organizationNumber }` still returns `201` with `customer=null`, and manager-by-email without `id` still returns `422`; the `3`-call minimum is unchanged
- production create on `2026-03-21` for `Oppgradering Fjelltopp` / `Fjelltopp AS` / `826557990` plus `torbjrn.stlsvik@example.org` also succeeded with the same exact `3`-call path and no follow-up reads; Nynorsk prompt language (`Prosjektleiar`, `knytt til`) was not a reason to add any extra read or change the standard flow
- production create on `2026-03-21` for `Implémentation Colline` / `Colline SARL` / `869753017` plus `ines.dubois@example.org` also succeeded with the same exact `3`-call path and no follow-up reads; French prompt language was not a reason to add any extra read, 10 consecutive optimal runs across en/pt/es/nb/nn/fr confirm the standard is stable and language-independent
- persistent sandbox re-proof on `2026-03-21` re-confirmed that nested customer `{ name, organizationNumber }` still returns `201` with `customer=null`, manager-by-email without `id` still returns `422 Feltet "Prosjektleder" må fylles ut.`, and both-nested still returns `422`; the `3`-call minimum is unchanged
- production create on `2026-03-21` for `Migrasjon Vestfjord` / `Vestfjord AS` / `887727872` plus `liv.stlsvik@example.org` also succeeded with the same exact `3`-call path and no follow-up reads; second Nynorsk prompt (`Prosjektleiar`, `knytt til`) handled identically, 12 consecutive optimal runs across en/pt/es/nb/nn/fr/de confirm the standard is fully language-independent
