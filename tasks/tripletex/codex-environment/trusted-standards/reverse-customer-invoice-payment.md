# Reverse Customer Invoice Payment

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- reverse one already-registered payment on one existing outgoing customer invoice
- prompt identifies the paid invoice strongly enough to find it in one decisive read
- prompt does not require creating the invoice first

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- the task includes creating or paying the invoice first
- the prompt is too ambiguous to isolate one invoice or one payment voucher safely
- the task is a supplier-invoice payment reversal
- the located invoice only exposes one shared voucher for both the invoice posting and the payment-style postings, such as after a combined `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?...paymentTypeId=...` prepayment flow

## Standard Flow
1. `GET /invoice?...&fields=*,customer(*),orderLines(*),orders(*),postings(*,voucher(*),account(*),customer(*),closeGroup(*))` to identify the exact paid invoice and extract its payment voucher id
2. `PUT /ledger/voucher/{paymentVoucherId}/:reverse?date=<reverse-date>`
3. stop
4. only if the task or local uncertainty truly requires explicit balance proof, `GET /invoice?...&id=<invoiceId>&fields=*,postings(*,voucher(*))` to verify the invoice outstanding amount reopened

## Payload Rules
- identify the invoice from prompt facts such as customer organization number, ex-VAT amount, and service text
- treat a prompt ex-VAT amount as a locate key, not as the post-reversal verification target
- prefer the prompt-provided reversal date; otherwise use the task date
- extract the payment voucher id from `postings[]`, not from a guessed invoice field
- for single-payment invoices, the payment voucher is usually the unique voucher referenced by postings with `type=INCOMING_PAYMENT` or `type=INCOMING_PAYMENT_OPPOSITE`
- if no such typed posting exists, accept the unique negative payment-style posting instead, with text such as `Betaling: ...`; the payment posting `type` can be `null`
- do not make the fallback matcher depend on `account.number`; `1500` is common, but the same winning posting can come back with `account=null`
- if the invoice posting and every negative payment-style posting all point to the same `voucher.id`, do not reverse that shared voucher under this standard; that is not the ordinary standalone-payment-reversal shape

## Reuse From Read / Write Responses
- from the first invoice read:
  - `invoice.id`
  - `paymentVoucherId`
  - only if you plan the optional verification read, the expected reopened outstanding amount from the invoice object itself, usually `amountCurrency` or `amount`
- from `PUT /ledger/voucher/{id}/:reverse`:
  - `value.id` of the reverse voucher

## Verification
- for exact-match scored runs, the default fast path is no verification read after the successful reverse write
- only do one decisive invoice re-read after the reversal when the prompt explicitly requires balance proof or the locate step left enough ambiguity that the extra read materially reduces risk
- on that optional re-read, verify `amountCurrencyOutstanding` or `amountOutstanding` equals the expected reopened balance captured from the first invoice read, not the prompt lookup amount
- do not spend an extra voucher read if the optional invoice verification already proves the scored state

## Known Recovery Branches
- if the first invoice read yields multiple paid invoices, narrow locally with the prompt identifiers before writing
- if several payment vouchers remain after prompt-based filtering, stop treating the task as an exact-match standard and inspect the specific vouchers more carefully

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- `/invoice` and `/ledger/voucher/{id}/:reverse` verified in `./openapi.json`
- exact reverse-payment flow re-proven on 2026-03-20 in sandbox and production
- sandbox re-proof on 2026-03-20 confirmed the score-optimal 2-call exact-match path once the paid invoice already existed: locate invoice, reverse payment voucher, stop
- the same sandbox proof on 2026-03-20 also confirmed the optional third-call verification branch: a later invoice read showed the outstanding amount reopened correctly after the reverse write
- persistent sandbox fixture invoice `38` / invoice id `2147531258` showed the payment posting as `amountCurrency=-1000`, `account.number=1500`, `description="Betaling: Faktura nummer 38 til Montanha Lda (10042)"`, `voucherId=608828379`, and `type=null`
- additional persistent-sandbox proof on 2026-03-20 with disposable invoice `56` / invoice id `2147536442` showed that `GET /invoice/{id}?fields=*,customer(*),orderLines(*,product(*)),orders(*,orderLines(*,product(*))),postings(*,voucher(*),account(*),customer(*),closeGroup(*))` already exposed the service text in top-level `orderLines[].description` / `displayName` and the reverse target as the unique negative `1500` posting with `type=null`
- persistent sandbox re-proof on 2026-03-20 with disposable invoice `64` / invoice id `2147537052` showed the same winning fallback shape with `type=null`, `description="Betaling: Faktura nummer 64 til Reflection Reverse Customer 1774032662638 (10076)"`, `amountCurrency=-1000`, `voucherId=608833573`, and `account=null`; treat missing `account.number` as normal, not as a reason to add a second locate read
- persistent sandbox re-proof on 2026-03-20 with disposable invoice `66` / invoice id `2147537237` re-confirmed both proof traps at once: the broad `/invoice?...id=...` search still returned `values=[]`, but direct `GET /invoice/{id}` exposed the correct reverse target as the unique negative `Betaling: ...` posting with `voucherId=608833742` and `account=null`
- production reflection on 2026-03-20 for the exact prompt shape `888412972` + `35800` + `Diseño web` showed that the write path itself was still the trusted 2-call flow, but one extra invoice read was wasted locally because the matcher rejected the real payment posting when `account.number` was absent; next time keep the first locate read authoritative and accept the unique negative `Betaling: ...` posting even when `account` is null
- production re-proof on 2026-03-20 for the exact prompt shape `998536561` + `32350` + `Programvarelisens` finished in the canonical 2-call path: one decisive `GET /invoice`, then `PUT /ledger/voucher/{id}/:reverse`, with no proof-only invoice re-read
- production re-proof on 2026-03-20 for the exact prompt shape `896496468` + `17200` + `Skylagring` also finished in the canonical 2-call path: one decisive `GET /invoice`, then `PUT /ledger/voucher/{id}/:reverse`, with no proof-only invoice re-read
- persistent sandbox reflection on 2026-03-20 for disposable invoice `76` / invoice id `2147538250` showed one important non-match branch: when the invoice was first created unpaid and then paid via `PUT /invoice/{id}/:payment`, reversal still worked normally through standalone payment voucher `608834712`; but a failed earlier proof fixture paid inside the combined `PUT /order/{id}/:invoice?...paymentTypeId=...` write and all invoice/payment postings landed on one shared voucher, so that combined-prepayment shape must not be treated as this standard's ordinary standalone-payment-reversal path
- that same persistent-sandbox proof also showed one sandbox-only trap: a broad same-day `GET /invoice?invoiceDateFrom=2000-01-01&invoiceDateTo=2026-03-20&count=1000...` omitted that freshly created paid invoice even though `GET /invoice/{id}` returned it immediately; do not let that sandbox omission push the production exact-match standard toward extra resolver calls
- persistent sandbox re-proof on 2026-03-20 with a prompt-like direct-line analog for `Skylagring` and ex-VAT `1000` repeated the same sandbox-only trap: the broad same-day `GET /invoice?...count=1000...` still returned zero matches immediately after a standalone `PUT /invoice/{id}/:payment`, while direct `GET /invoice/{id}` exposed the correct reverse target as the unique negative `Betaling: ...` posting with `voucherId=608862777`, `amountCurrency=-1000`, and `account.number=1500`; after `PUT /ledger/voucher/608862777/:reverse?date=2026-03-20`, the final direct invoice read showed `amountCurrencyOutstanding=1000` again
- production re-proof on 2026-03-21 for the exact prompt shape `962812384` + `41100` + `Sessão de formação` also finished in the canonical 2-call path: one decisive `GET /invoice?customerOrgNumber=962812384&invoiceDateFrom=2000-01-01&invoiceDateTo=2026-12-31&count=100&fields=*,customer(*),orderLines(*),orders(*),postings(*,voucher(*),account(*),customer(*),closeGroup(*))` returned exactly 1 invoice, then `PUT /ledger/voucher/608883353/:reverse?date=2026-03-21` completed with no proof-only re-read; the fallback matcher correctly accepted the unique negative `Betaling: ...` posting with `type=null`
- production re-proof on 2026-03-21 for the exact prompt shape `896496468` + `17200` + `Skylagring` finished in the canonical 2-call path again; the decisive `GET /invoice?customerOrgNumber=896496468...` returned `count=2` (two invoices for the same customer), the local filter on `amountExcludingVatCurrency === 17200` correctly isolated the target invoice, and `PUT /ledger/voucher/608886670/:reverse?date=2026-03-21` produced reverse voucher `609061798`; this is the first production confirmation where the multi-invoice local filter was exercised (previous runs for this org returned 1 invoice)
- sandbox re-proof on 2026-03-21 with disposable invoice `281` / invoice id `2147617116` confirmed the 2-call path with `type=null` fallback matcher: the payment posting had `description="Betaling: Faktura nummer 281..."`, `amountCurrency=-21500`, `voucherId=609063254`, `account.number=1500`; after `PUT /ledger/voucher/609063254/:reverse?date=2026-03-21`, the verification read showed `amountCurrencyOutstanding=17200`
- when matching invoices locally by the prompt ex-VAT amount, the correct field names on the invoice object are `amountExcludingVatCurrency` and `amountExcludingVat`, not `amountExVat` or `amountExVatCurrency`; using wrong field names can silently fail the local filter, though it is harmless when only one invoice exists for the customer
- `GET /invoice` for outgoing invoices rejects `fields=...payments(...)`; use `postings(...)` instead
