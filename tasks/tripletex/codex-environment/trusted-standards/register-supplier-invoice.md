# Register Supplier Invoice

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- register one supplier invoice as a ledger voucher
- prompt gives one supplier, one invoice number, one amount, one expense account, and VAT context
- task is a standard supplier-invoice booking, not a broader accounting workflow

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- prompt requires a feature-specific incoming-invoice module flow
- task is a reversal/correction flow
- prompt is missing the core accounting facts

## Standard Flow
1. create or resolve supplier
2. `GET /ledger/account?number=...&isApplicableForSupplierInvoice=true&fields=*`
3. `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=INCOMING&vatDate=<date>&fields=*`
4. `GET /ledger/voucherType?name=Leverandørfaktura&fields=*`
5. `POST /ledger/voucher`
6. verify from write response
7. stop

## Payload Rules
- prefer `POST /supplier` in fresh-account create-like tasks when supplier clearly does not exist yet
- use supplier linkage on supplier-liability posting
- do not use `POST /incomingInvoice` as default standard path
- do not send `amountVat`
- put supplier invoice number on the supplier posting `invoiceNumber`, not only on root voucher object
- let Tripletex generate the VAT posting automatically

## Reuse From Write Response
- supplier id
- supplier ledger account id for the `2400` liability posting
- voucher id
- posting count
- expense posting account/vat ids
- supplier posting supplier id / invoice number / due date

## Verification
- default verification is zero extra calls if `POST /ledger/voucher` response already proves the scored fields by ids and amounts
- in the fast path, verify the expense line by known `account.id`, `vatType.id`, `amount`, and `amountGross`
- in the fast path, verify the supplier line by known supplier-ledger `account.id`, `supplier.id`, negative gross amount, `invoiceNumber`, and `termOfPayment`
- expect linked display fields such as `account.number`, `vatType.number`, and `supplier.organizationNumber` to stay sparse in the write response
- only do `GET /ledger/voucher/{id}?fields=*` if the task needs those expanded linked fields or the write response omits a scored id/amount field

## Known Recovery Branches
- use `typeOfVat=INCOMING`, not `INCOMING_INVOICE`, for this voucher flow
- ledger postings to supplier accounts require supplier object linkage

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- `/supplier`, `/ledger/account`, `/ledger/vatType`, `/ledger/voucher` verified in `./openapi.json`
- voucher-based supplier-invoice flow proven in sandbox/playbooks
