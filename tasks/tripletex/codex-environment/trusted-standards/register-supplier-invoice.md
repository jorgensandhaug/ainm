# Register Supplier Invoice

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- register one ordinary unpaid supplier invoice
- prompt gives supplier identity, invoice number, gross amount, expense account, and VAT rate
- prompt is about registering the supplier invoice itself, not paying it
- supplier is identified by business fields such as `name` and `organizationNumber`, not by Tripletex id

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- prompt explicitly requires a different incoming-invoice feature flow
- task is reversal, approval, payment, or correction of an already-registered supplier invoice
- task comes with a real source document that must itself be preserved or uploaded exactly as given

## Standard Flow
1. `GET /supplier?organizationNumber=...&fields=*`
2. `GET /ledger/account?number=...&isApplicableForSupplierInvoice=true&fields=*`
3. `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=INCOMING&vatDate=<invoice-date>&fields=*`
4. `POST /ledger/voucher/importDocument` with a valid minimal EHF/UBL XML invoice carrying the prompt values
5. `PUT /ledger/voucher/{id}?sendToLedger=false` with a partial body containing only `version` and `postings`

## Minimal-Call Claim
- for the common existing-supplier shape, the canonical path is `5` API calls
- that `5`-call path is:
  1. `GET /supplier?organizationNumber=...&fields=*`
  2. `GET /ledger/account?number=...&isApplicableForSupplierInvoice=true&fields=*`
  3. `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=INCOMING&vatDate=<invoice-date>&fields=*`
  4. `POST /ledger/voucher/importDocument`
  5. `PUT /ledger/voucher/{id}?sendToLedger=false`
- only `POST /supplier` when the supplier lookup returns zero hits or the prompt explicitly says the supplier must be created
- the zero-hit supplier branch is `6` calls total; a 2026-03-20 persistent-sandbox re-proof for `Lumière SARL` / `913175212` / `INV-2026-7606` / `72350` / `6300` / `25%` used exactly that one-extra-call branch and still needed no verification read

## Why This Standard Exists
- direct `POST /ledger/voucher` can create a balanced voucher but not a real `supplierInvoice` object
- that voucher-only path scored `0/8` in production-like supplier-invoice tasks
- a valid EHF/XML import creates the `supplierInvoice` object first
- a partial `PUT /ledger/voucher/{id}` on that imported voucher can then add the correct accounting postings with correct VAT

## Payload Rules
- resolve supplier first and reuse `supplier.id` plus `supplier.ledgerAccount.id`
- resolve the expense account by `number` and require `isApplicableForSupplierInvoice=true`
- resolve incoming VAT on the actual invoice date; choose the requested percentage and prefer base code `number="1"` when present for ordinary `25%`
- import a valid EHF/UBL invoice; do not use arbitrary XML or PDF as the trusted fast path
- in the XML, carry the exact prompt-scored values for:
  - supplier name
  - supplier organization number
  - invoice number
  - invoice date
  - due date
  - line description
  - net amount
  - gross amount
  - VAT percentage
- on the later `PUT /ledger/voucher/{id}`, send only:
  - `version`
  - `postings`
- do not send `description`, `vendorInvoiceNumber`, or other immutable imported header fields in that `PUT`
- debit posting:
  - `account: { "id": <expense-account-id> }`
  - `description: <prompt description>`
  - `vatType: { "id": <incoming-vat-id> }`
  - `amount = net`
  - `amountCurrency = net`
  - `amountGross = gross`
  - `amountGrossCurrency = gross`
- supplier liability posting:
  - `account: { "id": <supplier-ledger-account-id> }`
  - `supplier: { "id": <supplier-id> }`
  - `description: <prompt description>`
  - `amount = -gross`
  - `amountCurrency = -gross`
  - `amountGross = -gross`
  - `amountGrossCurrency = -gross`
  - `invoiceNumber = <prompt invoice number>`
  - `termOfPayment = <due date>`
- let Tripletex auto-generate the VAT posting
- do not send `amountVat`
- do not default `sendToLedger=true`; the trusted sandbox proof is with `sendToLedger=false`
- if the prompt omits invoice date and due date, use the run date for XML issue/due dates and supplier-posting `termOfPayment`

## XML Rules
- the XML must be a valid-enough EHF/UBL invoice, not a dummy blob
- keep this minimal proven structure:
  - UBL `Invoice` root with the standard invoice namespaces
  - `cbc:CustomizationID = urn:cen.eu:en16931:2017#compliant#urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:3.0`
  - `cbc:ProfileID = urn:fdc:peppol.eu:2017:poacc:billing:01:1.0`
  - `cbc:InvoiceTypeCode = 380`
  - `cbc:DocumentCurrencyCode = NOK`
  - `cac:AccountingSupplierParty` with endpoint id, legal entity, tax scheme, and postal address
  - `cac:AccountingCustomerParty` with a stable buyer block; do not omit it just because the supplier is the scored entity
  - `cac:TaxTotal`
  - `cac:LegalMonetaryTotal`
  - one `cac:InvoiceLine` with item name, classified tax category, line extension amount, and price
- use the prompt description exactly in the invoice line item name
- use net amount in the XML line and totals, not gross
- earlier malformed/minimalized XML attempts failed with `422 Unable to identify document format`; do not improvise the structure

## Verification
- fast-path verification is zero extra calls
- trust the two writes together:
  - import creates the supplier invoice object family
  - voucher update response proves the final postings and VAT split
- a correct write response should show:
  - one manual debit posting on the requested expense account with requested incoming VAT type
  - one supplier liability posting linked to the supplier id
  - one system-generated VAT posting
- only add `GET /supplierInvoice?...` or `GET /ledger/voucher/{id}?fields=*` if the live write response contradicts the intended state or omits a scored field unexpectedly

## Known Recovery Branches
- if supplier lookup returns zero hits, create the supplier once and continue with the returned ids
- if supplier lookup returns several hits, continue only when exact `organizationNumber` plus exact `name` leaves one unique supplier
- if the incoming VAT lookup returns several rows with the requested percentage, prefer the plain base code such as `number="1"` over derived rows
- if the imported-voucher `PUT` returns validation that `description` or `vendorInvoiceNumber` cannot be changed, remove those fields from the `PUT`; they belong in the import, not the update
- if a one-line debit-only voucher update succeeds, that is not yet correct for taxable supplier invoices; use the balanced two-line update with currency amounts and explicit debit `vatType`
- if the two-line update omits currency amounts, sandbox proof showed `500`; keep `amountCurrency` and `amountGrossCurrency` on both rows

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- `/supplier`, `/ledger/account`, `/ledger/vatType`, `/ledger/voucher/importDocument`, and `/ledger/voucher/{id}` verified in `./openapi.json`
- 2026-03-20 sandbox proof:
  - exact original task values for `Elvdal AS` / `889157917` / `INV-2026-8662` / `39750` / `6500` / `25%`
  - imported voucher `608856087`
  - supplier invoice `2147547151`
  - final voucher update created:
    - expense posting `6500`, `vatType.id=1`, `amount=31800`, `amountGross=39750`
    - supplier posting `-39750` linked to supplier id
    - system VAT posting `7950`
- 2026-03-20 persistent-sandbox re-proof for the French office-services shape:
  - supplier `Lumière SARL` / `913175212`
  - invoice number `INV-SANDBOX-7606-1774045461190`
  - description `services de bureau`
  - gross `72350`
  - net `57880`
  - VAT `25%`
  - expense account `6300`
  - supplier lookup returned zero hits, so the run used the `6`-call create branch
  - imported voucher `608864697`
  - final voucher update returned:
    - expense row on `6300` with `vatType.id=1`, `amount=57880`, `amountGross=72350`
    - supplier row `-72350` linked to the created supplier id
    - system VAT row `14470`
