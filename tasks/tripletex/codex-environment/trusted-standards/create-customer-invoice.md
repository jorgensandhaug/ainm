# Create Customer Invoice

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- create one outgoing invoice
- do not send it
- customer already exists or is resolvable in one decisive read
- products either already exist or lines are directly creatable from prompt
- prompt is a standard customer-invoice create, not payment or reversal

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- prompt requires sending after create
- prompt requires a custom multi-order workflow
- task is a correction/reversal/payment flow

## Standard Flow
1. resolve customer with one decisive `GET /customer?...&fields=*` if needed
2. resolve existing products only if prompt clearly references existing products
   - if the prompt clearly gives exact product numbers, prefer one decisive `GET /product?productNumber=<a>&productNumber=<b>...&fields=*`
   - if the prompt gives exact product names plus parenthetical numeric refs of unclear semantics, prefer one decisive `GET /product?count=1000&fields=*` and local exact filtering by product `number` and/or product `name`
   - only fall back from the direct numeric query or catalog read to the next resolver if the earlier read is ambiguous, truncated for the account, or the prompt lacks exact product names
   - only spend `GET /product?ids=...` if the earlier resolver still leaves the products unresolved
   - if you do start with a speculative product-number resolver and it returns an incomplete subset, keep the broader product-catalog fallback inside the same script and reuse the already-resolved customer instead of restarting the whole flow
3. if the prompt gives exact VAT rates and the resolved product read does not itself expose enough VAT detail, resolve `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=<date>&fields=*`
4. `POST /invoice?sendToCustomer=false`
5. only if the write response omits decisive totals or later logic truly needs readback-only line details, do one immediate `GET /invoice/{id}?fields=*,customer(*),orders(*,orderLines(*,product(*),vatType(*))),orderLines(*,product(*),vatType(*))`
6. stop

## Payload Rules
- include:
  - `invoiceDate`
  - `invoiceDueDate`
  - `customer: { "id": ... }`
  - lines under `orders[].orderLines`
- do not create lines under read-only `invoice.orderLines`
- for product-linked lines, prefer `product: { "id": ... }`
- do not send unless prompt explicitly asks
- do not hardcode output VAT code `3`
- if `GET /product?fields=*` returns `vatType` only as `id`/`url`, that is not enough to prove an explicit prompt VAT percentage
- if the filtered outgoing VAT read shows that the resolved product `vatType.id` already maps to the prompt percentage, you may still omit explicit line `vatType`
- if the filtered outgoing VAT read shows a mismatch and the desired percentage exists, force that line with `vatType: { "id": ... }`

## Reuse From Write Response
- `value.id`
- `value.invoiceNumber`
- totals from invoice write response
- sparse line objects still prove line count, not full line details
- if the payload already fixed `product`, `description`, `count`, `unitPriceExcludingVatCurrency`, and explicit line `vatType`, and the write response returns decisive totals (`amountExcludingVatCurrency` / `amountCurrency`), that is enough to stop on a create-only task

## Verification
- default verification is zero extra calls if invoice totals/existence are enough
- sparse `orderLines` alone are not a reason to fetch the invoice again when the payload already fixed the line data and the write response totals match the intended VAT mix
- use one immediate expanded `GET /invoice/{id}` only when exact scored line details still need proof or the write response is too thin to prove the financial outcome

## Known Recovery Branches
- if the first attempted API call returns `403` with body `{"error":"Invalid or expired token"}`, stop; the run is blocked by unusable credentials, not by invoice-flow uncertainty
- if invoice creation fails with missing company bank account:
  - `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*`
  - update existing invoice account with `PUT /ledger/account/{id}`
  - retry invoice write once
- if the one-shot product catalog read is ambiguous or incomplete, use the documented numeric recovery chain instead of guessing from approximate matches
- if a speculative `GET /product?productNumber=...` returns only a partial subset on a name-rich prompt, do the broader catalog fallback in the same script; do not re-read the customer or rerun the whole flow from the top

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- `/invoice`, `/ledger/account`, and related invoice family endpoints verified in `./openapi.json`
- flow and bank-account repair proven in sandbox/playbooks
- production reflection on 2026-03-20 for the exact prompt shape `customer.organizationNumber=827304212` with product numbers `6744`, `2584`, `3739` and VAT mix `25%` / `15%` / `0%` showed that `GET /customer` -> `GET /product?productNumber=...` -> `GET /ledger/vatType` -> `POST /invoice?sendToCustomer=false` was already the minimum successful API path; the only failure was a local gross-total assertion bug after the successful write, not an API-flow error
- production reflection on 2026-03-20 for the exact prompt shape `customer.organizationNumber=925760838` with products labeled `(3644)`, `(4934)`, `(8806)` plus exact names showed that two numeric product-resolver reads were wasted before a later catalog read settled the products; the lower-call replacement for that shape is one decisive `GET /product?count=1000&fields=*` with local exact filtering by `number` and/or `name`
- production reflection on 2026-03-20 for the exact prompt shape `customer.organizationNumber=851635874` with lines `Analyserapport (2934)`, `Datarådgivning (8699)`, and `Nettverkstjeneste (1355)` plus VAT `25%` / `15%` / `0%` showed that a speculative `GET /product?productNumber=2934&productNumber=8699&productNumber=1355&fields=*` did not resolve all lines, and the run only succeeded after a broader catalog fallback on exact names; the lower-call replacement for that shape is one decisive `GET /product?count=1000&fields=*`, then `GET /ledger/vatType`, then `POST /invoice?sendToCustomer=false`
- the same `851635874` run also showed a control-flow inefficiency: the product-fallback logic happened only after the first script aborted, which forced a duplicate customer read on the second script run; next time keep the fallback as an in-script callback/branch and reuse the first successful customer resolution
- re-verified on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox that `GET /product?productNumber=...&fields=*` can return `vatType` only as a link object (`id`/`url`), so explicit-VAT prompts may still need one filtered outgoing `vatType` lookup before the invoice write
- re-verified on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox that `POST /invoice?sendToCustomer=false` can return sparse `orderLines` while still returning decisive totals; when the create payload already fixes the scored line fields, that write response is enough for the minimal create-only path
- re-verified on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with the exact customer/product-number shape `827304212` + `6744/2584/3739` that the proof path is still `GET /customer` -> `GET /product?productNumber=...` -> `GET /ledger/vatType` -> `POST /invoice?sendToCustomer=false`; that sandbox account exposed only outgoing VAT `0%`, so the exact mixed `25%` / `15%` / `0%` write could not be replayed there and only a 0%-analog invoice could be proven in-account
- re-verified again on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with a disposable analog that exact-name product resolution plus `GET /ledger/vatType` plus `POST /invoice?sendToCustomer=false` completes the proof path in four calls after setup; that sandbox account still exposed only `0%` outgoing VAT, so mixed `25%` / `15%` / `0%` could not be replayed there
- re-verified again on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox with an analog customer and exact-name products whose stored product numbers intentionally differed from prompt-like refs `2934` / `8699` / `1355`; after setup, the winning proof path was exactly `GET /customer?organizationNumber=851635875&fields=*` -> `GET /product?count=1000&fields=*` -> `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=2026-03-20&fields=*` -> `POST /invoice?sendToCustomer=false`, and the created invoice returned `amountExcludingVatCurrency=53050` and `amountCurrency=53050`
