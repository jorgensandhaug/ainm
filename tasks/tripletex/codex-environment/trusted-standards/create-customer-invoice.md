# Create Customer Invoice

## Trust Level
- Trusted standard
- Use directly for exact matches
- Skip `./openapi.json` re-checking for exact matches

## Exact Match
- create one outgoing invoice
- do not send it
- customer already exists or is resolvable in one decisive read
- products either already exist or lines are directly creatable from prompt
- prompt is a standard customer-invoice create, not payment or reversal

## Do Not Use This Standard If
- prompt requires sending after create
- prompt requires a custom multi-order workflow
- task is a correction/reversal/payment flow

## Standard Flow
1. resolve customer with one decisive `GET /customer?...&fields=*` if needed
2. resolve existing products only if prompt clearly references existing products
3. if the prompt gives exact VAT rates and the resolved product read does not itself expose enough VAT detail, resolve `GET /ledger/vatType?typeOfVat=OUTGOING&vatDate=<date>&fields=*`
4. `POST /invoice?sendToCustomer=false`
5. only if line-level proof is still needed and write response is sparse, do one immediate `GET /invoice/{id}?fields=*,customer(*),orders(*,orderLines(*,product(*),vatType(*))),orderLines(*,product(*),vatType(*))`
6. stop

## Payload Rules
- include:
  - `invoiceDate`
  - `invoiceDueDate`
  - `customer: { "id": ... }`
  - lines under `orders[].orderLines`
- do not create lines under read-only `invoice.orderLines`
- for product-linked lines, prefer `product: { "id": ... }`
- do not send unless prompt explicitly asks
- do not hardcode output VAT code `3`
- if `GET /product?fields=*` returns `vatType` only as `id`/`url`, that is not enough to prove an explicit prompt VAT percentage
- if the filtered outgoing VAT read shows that the resolved product `vatType.id` already maps to the prompt percentage, you may still omit explicit line `vatType`
- if the filtered outgoing VAT read shows a mismatch and the desired percentage exists, force that line with `vatType: { "id": ... }`

## Reuse From Write Response
- `value.id`
- `value.invoiceNumber`
- totals from invoice write response
- sparse line objects still prove line count, not full line details

## Verification
- default verification is zero extra calls if invoice totals/existence are enough
- use one immediate expanded `GET /invoice/{id}` only when exact scored line details still need proof

## Known Recovery Branches
- if the first attempted API call returns `403` with body `{"error":"Invalid or expired token"}`, stop; the run is blocked by unusable credentials, not by invoice-flow uncertainty
- if invoice creation fails with missing company bank account:
  - `GET /ledger/account?isBankAccount=true&fields=*`
  - update existing invoice account with `PUT /ledger/account/{id}`
  - retry invoice write once
- if product numeric refs partially resolve, follow documented product fallback chain instead of stopping

## OpenAPI / Sandbox Status
- `/invoice`, `/ledger/account`, and related invoice family endpoints verified in `./openapi.json`
- flow and bank-account repair proven in sandbox/playbooks
- re-verified on 2026-03-20 in persistent sandbox that `GET /product?productNumber=...&fields=*` can return `vatType` only as a link object (`id`/`url`), so explicit-VAT prompts may still need one filtered outgoing `vatType` lookup before the invoice write
