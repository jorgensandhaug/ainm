# Register Travel Expense

## Scope

Use for tasks like:
- register one new travel expense for an existing employee identified by email
- create travel costs such as flight, taxi, ferry, hotel, or similar reimbursement lines
- include per-diem compensation in the same travel expense
- prompt gives explicit travel dates, or some other non-Tripletex source already fixes those dates exactly
- finish in one parent write plus only the verification reads that are actually needed

Do not use for:
- mileage allowance
- accommodation allowance
- attachments
- standalone approval or delivery of an existing travel expense
- project-linked or reinvoiced travel expenses
- duration-only prompts that omit explicit travel dates; treat those as ambiguous investigation cases, not as an exact playbook match

## Key Findings

Verified in persistent sandbox on 2026-03-20:
- `GET /travelExpense/costCategory?count=1000&fields=*` returned travel categories with `showOnTravelExpenses=true`, including `Fly` and `Taxi`
- `GET /travelExpense/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*` returned one active travel-expense payment type, `Privat utlegg`
- `GET /travelExpense/rate?type=PER_DIEM&isValidDomestic=true&dateFrom=...&dateTo=...&count=1000&fields=*` returned the live per-diem `rateType` options needed for a deliverable overnight trip
- `GET /company/{companyId}?fields=*,address(*)` expanded the company address in one read, while `fields=*` alone left `company.address` as a link-only object
- one no-address employee (`id=18478235`, `address=null`, `companyId=108114337`) plus that company read yielded concrete `departureFrom="Oslo"` from `company.address.city`
- the exact 7-call branch `GET /employee` -> conditional `GET /company/{companyId}?fields=*,address(*)` -> `GET /travelExpense/costCategory` -> `GET /travelExpense/paymentType` -> `GET /travelExpense/rate` -> `POST /travelExpense` -> `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` delivered sandbox travel expense `11145429` with `2` costs and `1` per-diem row
- `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` returned `ListResponseTravelExpense` with the delivered object inside `values[]`
- that same filtered rate response returned `rateCategory` only as sparse `id`/`url`, not expanded booleans such as `isValidDomestic`
- one returned sparse `rateType.id` still allowed a delivered manual per-diem row to persist `count=4`, `rate=800`, and `amount=3200`
- `POST /travelExpense` can create the parent expense, embedded cost rows, and embedded per-diem rows in one write
- `POST /travelExpense` did not need an explicit `department` field when the linked employee already had a department; the created expense inherited that department automatically
- embedded `costs[]` failed with `422` until each row included `amountCurrencyIncVat`
- embedded `perDiemCompensations[]` failed with `422` while `travelDetails.isCompensationFromRates=false`
- changing `travelDetails.isCompensationFromRates` to `true` allowed the same embedded per-diem row to persist with manual `count`, `rate`, and `amount`
- the old create-only branch persisted manual per-diem rows with `rateType=null`, `rateCategory=null`, and `overnightAccommodation=NONE`
- `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` then failed on missing `travelDetails.departureFrom`, missing `perDiemCompensations[].rateType`, and VAT-bearing `costs[].vatType` on a non-VAT-registered sandbox company
- recreating with `travelDetails.departureFrom`, explicit `costs[].vatType={ "id": 0 }`, and per-diem `rateType` plus `overnightAccommodation` allowed `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` to succeed and move the expense to `state=DELIVERED`
- the `POST /travelExpense` response already proved the parent fields and returned child ids/counts, but `costs[]` and `perDiemCompensations[]` came back only as `id`/`url`
- `GET /travelExpense/{id}?fields=*` still kept those child arrays sparse
- `GET /travelExpense/cost?travelExpenseId=...&count=20&fields=*` returned full cost objects with comments, amounts, category ids, and payment-type ids
- `GET /travelExpense/perDiemCompensation?travelExpenseId=...&count=20&fields=*` returned full per-diem objects with `location`, `count`, `rate`, and `amount`
- `PUT /travelExpense/:approve` returned `403` for the sandbox token even with `overrideApprovalFlow=true`; approval is not a trusted default follow-up step
- top-level travel-expense `amount`/`paymentAmount` still reflected only reimbursable cost lines even after successful `:deliver`; those totals are not proof of per-diem correctness
- the 2026-03-20 production run for Torbjorn Brekke likely lost correctness by inventing `departureFrom=\"Hjemsted\"`; when the prompt omits departureFrom, generic placeholders are correctness-risky and should not be upgraded into a trusted inference
- the 2026-03-20 production run for `Miguel Pérez` / `miguel.perez@example.org` wasted two extra `GET /employee` calls by stopping at `address=null` and only later adding the company fallback; future agents should switch to the company branch immediately after the first employee read reveals no address
- ambiguity probe script `sandbox_travel_expense_ambiguity_probe.ts` then delivered three otherwise-identical Bergen expenses with different inferred values:
  - `11145899`: `2026-03-17..2026-03-20`, `departureFrom=Oslo`
  - `11145900`: `2026-03-16..2026-03-19`, `departureFrom=Oslo`
  - `11145901`: `2026-03-17..2026-03-20`, `departureFrom=Drammen`
- Tripletex accepted all three as `DELIVERED`, so the API does not tell you which date/departure inference is scorer-correct when the prompt omits those fields
- same-day sandbox re-proof `sandbox_verify_duration_only_travel_expense.ts` used the known no-address employee `18478235` with company fallback `Oslo` and delivered two otherwise-identical Bodø expenses for the exact `3 days` / `800 per day` / `6200 flight` / `400 taxi` family:
  - `11146082`: `2026-03-18..2026-03-20`, `departureFrom=Oslo`
  - `11146083`: `2026-03-17..2026-03-19`, `departureFrom=Oslo`
- that Bodø re-proof shows the ambiguity survives even after the company-city fallback is fixed; extra Tripletex reads will not reveal a unique scorer-correct date range

## Lowest-Call Scored Flow

This is the canonical flow only when the travel dates are explicit or otherwise fixed from outside Tripletex.

1. Confirm these operations in `./openapi.json`
   - `GET /employee`
   - `GET /company/{id}`
   - `GET /travelExpense/costCategory`
   - `GET /travelExpense/paymentType`
   - `GET /travelExpense/rate`
   - `POST /travelExpense`
   - `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver`
2. Locate the employee with one decisive read
   - usually `GET /employee?email=<prompt-email>&count=10&fields=*`
   - filter locally to one exact-email employee
   - prefer `allowInformationRegistration=true` when several exact-email hits exist
3. If the prompt omits `departureFrom` and the employee read lacks a concrete address but exposes `companyId`, do one conditional company read
   - `GET /company/{companyId}?fields=*,address(*)`
   - prefer `company.address.city`, then `company.address.addressLine1`, then `company.address.displayName`, then `company.address.addressAsString`
   - if both employee and company location fields are absent, treat the run as blocked instead of inventing a placeholder
4. Resolve one travel payment type, the required cost categories, and a compatible per-diem rate type
   - `GET /travelExpense/costCategory?count=1000&fields=*`
   - `GET /travelExpense/paymentType?count=1000&fields=*`
   - `GET /travelExpense/rate?type=PER_DIEM&isValidDomestic=true&dateFrom=<departureDate>&dateTo=<returnDate>&count=1000&fields=*`
   - filter locally on `showOnTravelExpenses=true`
   - do not locally require `rateCategory.isValidDomestic` or `rateCategory.isRequiresOvernightAccommodation` after that filtered rate call; the response can be sparse link-only data
   - prefer a returned `rate` equal to the prompt day rate when such a row exists; otherwise reuse any returned `rateType.id`
5. Create the travel expense in one write
   - `POST /travelExpense`
   - embed top-level `travelDetails`
   - embed `perDiemCompensations[]`
   - embed `costs[]`
   - include `travelDetails.departureFrom`
   - include explicit `costs[].vatType`
   - include `perDiemCompensations[].rateType`
   - include `perDiemCompensations[].overnightAccommodation` when the trip spans overnight
   - omit `department` unless the prompt explicitly scores a different department or validation demands it
6. Deliver the expense
   - `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver?id=<travelExpenseId>`
7. Reuse the deliver response and stop
   - `title`
   - `employee.id`
   - `travelDetails.departureDate`
   - `travelDetails.returnDate`
   - `travelDetails.destination`
   - `state=DELIVERED`
   - `costs.length`
   - `perDiemCompensations.length`
8. Stop

## Conditional Investigation Branch

Use the dedicated child reads only when the prompt materially differs from the standard embedded-create shape, a later step truly needs expanded child fields, or the live write/deliver response contradicts the intended child counts.

1. `GET /travelExpense/cost?travelExpenseId=<id>&count=20&fields=*`
2. `GET /travelExpense/perDiemCompensation?travelExpenseId=<id>&count=20&fields=*`
3. Stop

## Winning Payload Shape

For the travel-expense create, the sandbox-proven shape was:

```json
{
  "employee": { "id": 18478235 },
  "title": "Visita cliente Bergen",
  "travelDetails": {
    "isForeignTravel": false,
    "isDayTrip": false,
    "isCompensationFromRates": true,
    "departureDate": "2026-03-19",
    "returnDate": "2026-03-20",
    "departureTime": "08:00",
    "returnTime": "18:00",
    "destination": "Bergen",
    "detailedJourneyDescription": "Visita cliente Bergen",
    "purpose": "Visita cliente Bergen"
  },
  "perDiemCompensations": [
    {
      "location": "Bergen",
      "count": 2,
      "rate": 800,
      "amount": 1600
    }
  ],
  "costs": [
    {
      "costCategory": { "id": 32813722 },
      "paymentType": { "id": 32813706 },
      "comments": "bilhete de avião",
      "amountCurrencyIncVat": 5200,
      "amountNOKInclVAT": 5200,
      "date": "2026-03-19"
    },
    {
      "costCategory": { "id": 32813737 },
      "paymentType": { "id": 32813706 },
      "comments": "táxi",
      "amountCurrencyIncVat": 350,
      "amountNOKInclVAT": 350,
      "date": "2026-03-20"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Validation Traps

- do not omit `amountCurrencyIncVat` on embedded travel costs just because the prompt amount is already in NOK
- do not set `travelDetails.isCompensationFromRates=false` when the same write also includes `perDiemCompensations[]`
- do not waste effort resolving or echoing `department` for a normal existing-employee expense; Tripletex can inherit it from the employee
- do not rerun `GET /employee` after the first read already proved the employee identity and `address=null`; switch directly to the conditional company-address branch
- do not use `GET /company/{companyId}?fields=*` for the fallback; it leaves `company.address` as a link-only object in sandbox, so use `fields=*,address(*)`
- do not trust a successful `POST /travelExpense` with manual per-diem `count`/`rate`/`amount` as a fully correct final state; that row can still persist with `rateType=null`
- do not rely on the category default VAT if the expense may need `:deliver`; explicit zero-VAT cost rows were required in sandbox for a non-VAT-registered company
- do not assume approval is available after delivery; sandbox `PUT /travelExpense/:approve` returned `403`
- do not assume `GET /travelExpense/{id}?fields=*` expands child rows; it can stay link-only for both costs and per-diems

## Category And Payment-Type Resolution

- `GET /travelExpense/costCategory` does not expose a query parameter equivalent to `showOnTravelExpenses=true`, so fetch the set once and filter locally
- prefer exact category-description matches before fallback heuristics:
  - `Fly` for airfare
  - `Taxi` for taxi
- for the payment type, prefer one active travel-expense reimbursement type from the lookup; persistent sandbox exposed `Privat utlegg`

## Per-Diem Resolution

- for multi-day domestic per-diem tasks, resolve one compatible live `rateType` from `GET /travelExpense/rate?...fields=*`; do not leave `perDiemCompensations[].rateType` empty
- the filtered rate search can already be authoritative even when `rateCategory` stays sparse; do not spend `GET /travelExpense/rateCategory/{id}` just to expand booleans
- preserve the prompt's scored `count`, `rate`, and `amount`, but still include a compatible `rateType` so the row is deliverable
- if the trip spans overnight, set `overnightAccommodation`; sandbox accepted the generic branch `HOTEL`
- if the prompt omits `departureFrom`, only infer it from one concrete employee address field already returned by `GET /employee`, preferring `address.city`, then `address.addressLine1`, then `address.displayName`
- if those employee address fields are absent but the employee exposes `companyId`, use one conditional `GET /company/{companyId}?fields=*,address(*)` and infer from `company.address.city`, then `company.address.addressLine1`, then `company.address.displayName`, then `company.address.addressAsString`
- do not invent generic placeholders such as `Hjemsted`; if both employee and company reads lack a concrete location, this prompt shape is blocked
- if the prompt omits `departureFrom` or gives too little information to choose an overnight-accommodation branch safely, the old 4-call OPEN create is not a trusted full-correctness path for that prompt shape
- if the prompt omits explicit travel dates as well, this is not an exact playbook match; sandbox proved several delivered date/departure combinations are possible, so do not pretend one default inference is trusted

## Forced-Action Branch For Ambiguous Prompts

- If the agent must still act autonomously on a duration-only prompt, keep the flow minimal instead of trying to "solve" the ambiguity with extra reads.
- Use one decisive `GET /employee?email=...&count=10&fields=*`.
- If `employee.address` is null but `companyId` exists, do one `GET /company/{companyId}?fields=*,address(*)` and reuse that concrete location for `departureFrom`.
- Then go straight to the normal deliverable tail: `GET /travelExpense/costCategory`, `GET /travelExpense/paymentType`, `GET /travelExpense/rate`, `POST /travelExpense`, `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver`.
- Choose one deterministic local date range inside the script, but document that it is only a best-effort fallback; sandbox proved multiple ranges are accepted, so there is no extra-read path that recovers a uniquely correct answer from Tripletex itself.

## Date Ambiguity For Underspecified Prompts

- do not encode a trusted default fallback for prompts that give only a duration
- sandbox accepted both `2026-03-17..2026-03-20` and `2026-03-16..2026-03-19` for the same 4-day Bergen probe, and it also accepted different `departureFrom` values
- because Tripletex accepts several delivered variants, omitted dates and omitted `departureFrom` are scorer ambiguities, not API-shape ambiguities
- for that prompt family, the correct post-run learning action is to narrow the trusted standard, not to hardcode another guessed fallback date range

## Verification Shape

- `POST /travelExpense` verified the parent expense and returned:
  - the parent `id`
  - the linked `employee.id`
  - the requested `travelDetails`
  - `costs[].id/url` plus count
  - `perDiemCompensations[].id/url` plus count
- `PUT /travelExpense/:deliver` verified the corrected final parent state and returned `state=DELIVERED`
- the parent `amount`/`paymentAmount` remained cost-only in sandbox, so they are not decisive proof of per-diem correctness
- `GET /travelExpense/cost?...` and `GET /travelExpense/perDiemCompensation?...` remain the decisive investigation branch when expanded child verification is genuinely needed

## When Not To Add Extra Reads

- do not add a pre-read of `/travelExpense` for a pure create task
- do not repeat `GET /employee`; for omitted-`departureFrom` tasks the full resolver branch is one employee read plus, if needed, one company read
- do not add `GET /travelExpense/cost` or `GET /travelExpense/perDiemCompensation` in the standard scored flow just to double-check child persistence
- do not add `GET /travelExpense/{id}`; it still leaves child arrays sparse and is not part of either the canonical scoring path or the conditional investigation branch
- do not split the create into separate `POST /travelExpense/cost` and `POST /travelExpense/perDiemCompensation` calls unless the prompt materially differs from the embedded-create shape
- do not add exploratory `GET /travelExpense`, repeated `GET /employee`, or alternate company/address probes just because the prompt omitted dates; those calls still do not tell you which inferred range is scorer-correct
